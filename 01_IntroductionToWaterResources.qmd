# Objectives

- Understand the global and regional importance of water resources
- Introduce the hydrologic cycle and its main components
- Understand the concept of water residence times and hydrologic budgets
- Recognize the challenges related to water quantity and quality globally and in Australia
- Set the stage for deeper exploration of hydrologic processes in later lectures

# The Importance of Water Resources

- Essential for life: 98% of accessible freshwater is in groundwater
- Scarcity and uneven distribution globally (e.g., >1 billion people lack clean water)
- Key issues:
  - Supply (quantity & quality)
  - Droughts and floods
  - Climate change impacts
  - Contamination (chemical, physical, biological)

---

# Water in the Australian Context

- Australia = driest inhabited continent
- Rainfall is extremely variable and drought-prone
- Need for sustainable use and evidence-based water management
- Key institutions:
  - National Water Initiative
  - Bureau of Meteorology Water Information
  - National Water Commission (historical)

---

# Water Use in Australia

- High consumption for agriculture, especially in Murray-Darling Basin
- Usage stats by sector (e.g., agriculture, household, mining)
- National and state breakdown of water consumption (NSW, VIC, QLD, etc.)

---

# Water Quality Considerations

- "Good" quality depends on use: drinking, irrigation, stock, industrial
- Key quality indicators:
  - Salinity, turbidity, nutrients, metals, microbes
- Australian standards and guidelines:
  - National Water Quality Management Strategy
  - ANZECC & NHMRC guidelines

# Where is Earth’s Water?

- Total water on Earth: ~96.5% in oceans (saline)
- Freshwater breakdown:
  - Glaciers/icecaps
  - Groundwater
  - Surface water (rivers, lakes, soil moisture, biota)
- Usable water is a tiny fraction of Earth’s total

# The Hydrologic Cycle

- Global water transfer: evaporation → precipitation → runoff/infiltration → return to oceans
- Components: evaporation, transpiration, precipitation, infiltration, runoff, storage
- Operates across scales: global, continental, regional, catchment

---

# Water Residence Times

- Atmosphere: ~8–10 days
- Rivers: ~2 weeks
- Lakes: ~10 years
- Groundwater: weeks to >10,000 years
- Importance for understanding response times to environmental change

---

# Hydrologic Budgets

- Water balance equation:

$$ΔS = Qi - Qo + Gi - Go + P - ET $$

- Can be applied at any scale (global, regional, catchment)
- Inputs: precipitation, inflows
- Outputs: evaporation, transpiration, outflows
- Storage change: surface and subsurface

---

# Case Study: Long Island Water Budget

- Inputs vs. outputs illustrate near-steady-state assumption
- Importance of recharge, pumping impacts, and sustainability
- Budget scenarios demonstrate:
- Streamflow depletion
- Seawater intrusion

---

# Measurement Techniques

- Precipitation: rain gauges (manual, tipping bucket), BoM data
- Evaporation: Class A pans, energy balance
- ET: lysimeters, remote sensing, empirical models
- Streamflow: flow meters, weirs
- Groundwater: Darcy’s law, piezometers, numerical models

---

# Summary

- Water is vital but unevenly distributed and under pressure
- The hydrologic cycle and budget frameworks help quantify and manage water
- Measurement techniques support data-driven water management
- Sets the stage for detailed process-level exploration in subsequent lectures
