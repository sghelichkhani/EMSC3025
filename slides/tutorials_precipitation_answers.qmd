##! Precipitation

#### Top End Thunderstorms

| Required condition | Why essential |
|--------------------|--------------|
| *i.* **Atmospheric cooling to dew-point** (by convective uplift in Darwin) | Lowers saturation vapour pressure; allows condensation to start. |
| *ii.* **Abundant condensation nuclei** (sea-salt, smoke from bushfires) | Provide surfaces for initial microscopic droplet formation; without them, air can remain supersaturated. |
| *iii.* **Droplet growth to > ~ 3 mm** (collision–coalescence in warm clouds) | Gives droplets sufficient mass to overcome up-draughts and fall as rain. |

If any one is missing, vapour remains suspended, clouds persist without rainfall, or virga evaporates before reaching ground.

## A 2 Singapore vs Scottish Highlands

a. Singapore ⇒ **collision–coalescence** in warm (> 0 °C) cumulonimbus; Highlands ⇒ **Bergeron (ice-crystal) process** in mixed-phase nimbostratus.

b. Singapore: whole cloud above freezing, strong up-draughts → droplets of different radii collide & merge.  Highlands: vertical cross-section spans −5 °C to −15 °C; ice crystals grow at expense of super-cooled droplets because e_s(ice) < e_s(liq); moderate lifting in frontal system.

c. Warm-cloud rain gives **large, uniform raindrops**, often > 2 mm, causing high-intensity bursts (> 100 mm h⁻¹).  Bergeron process yields **smaller frozen aggregates**, which melt on descent → lower intensity but longer-lasting precipitation, w/ mixed graupel or wet snow.

## A 3 Sierra Nevada

*(Annotated copy required.)*

a.i. Max orographic band = 1 000–3 000 m on windward (western) flank.
a.ii. Rain shadow = Owens Valley east of crest (< 300 mm yr⁻¹).

b. Dry-adiabatic: 9.8 °C km⁻¹ up to LCL (~1 200 m), then saturated rate 6 °C km⁻¹ to 3 000 m: ΔT ≈ −23 °C.  Descent: warms at dry rate: +29 °C to valley floor.

c. Example towns: **Bishop, Lone Pine.**  Both import water via Los Angeles Aqueduct; pumping from deep alluvial fans carefully managed because local recharge is minimal under rain-shadow conditions.

## A 4 Pará Clearing Experiment

Total rainfall: Forest = 112 mm; Pasture = 132 mm (≈ +15 %).

Possible biases & fixes

| Bias / micro-site factor | Likely effect | Mitigation |
|--------------------------|--------------|------------|
| Dense canopy causes **interception loss** before drops reach gauge orifice. | Under-catch at Forest site. | Install *trough* throughfall collectors + stemflow collars to quantify interception; or raise gauge above understory in a tower. |
| **Wind-turbulence** differences: clearing exposed → eddies may enhance Pasture catch. | Over-catch at Pasture. | Equip both gauges with Alter shields, measure local wind speed for correction factors. |
| **Splash-in from drip points** off overhanging leaves near Forest gauge. | Over-catch on intense days, but net effect variable. | Clear 1 m radius around gauge; fit non-splash grid. |

A succinct paired-bar plot (Forest vs Pasture, 14 bars) completes part (a).

## A 5 Himalayan Catchment

a. **Hypsometric method** chosen.

b. Because gauges cluster low (< 1 800 m) yet ~40 % of basin lies above snowline, rainfall–altitude gradient is strong & non-linear.  Thiessen would over-weight lowlands; hypsometric belts (e.g. 500 m intervals) allocate snowfall intensities based on elevation and aspect → better represent orographic input and snow-water storage.

c. Supplement **GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) IMERG satellite** or regional weather-radar composites.  Calibrate bias using available gauges; blend with hypsometric zones through kriging or Bias-Corrected Precipitation Reconstruction (BCPR) to refine daily grids.
