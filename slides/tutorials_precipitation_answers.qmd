# Precipitation
## Top End Thunderstorms

| Required condition | Why essential |
|--------------------|--------------|
| *i*. **Atmospheric cooling to dew-point** (by convective uplift in Darwin) | Lowers saturation vapour pressure; allows condensation to start. |
| *ii*. **Abundant condensation nuclei** (sea-salt, smoke from bushfires) | Provide surfaces for initial microscopic droplet formation; without them, air can remain supersaturated. |
| *iii*. **Droplet growth to $ > \approx 3 mm $** (collision–coalescence in warm clouds) | Gives droplets sufficient mass to overcome up-draughts and fall as rain. |

If any one is missing, vapour remains suspended, clouds persist without rainfall, or virga evaporates before reaching ground.

## Singapore vs Scottish Highlands
- Singapore => **collision–coalescence** in warm (> 0 °C) cumulonimbus; Highlands => **Bergeron (ice-crystal) process** in mixed-phase nimbostratus.
- Singapore: whole cloud above freezing, strong up-draughts -> droplets of different radii collide & merge.  Highlands: vertical cross-section spans −5 °C to −15 °C; ice crystals grow at expense of super-cooled droplets because $ e_{s, \ ice} < e_{s, \ liq} $; moderate lifting in frontal system.
- Warm-cloud rain gives **large, uniform raindrops**, often $ > 2 mm $, causing high-intensity bursts ($ > 100 \ mm  \ h^{-1} $).  Bergeron process yields **smaller frozen aggregates**, which melt on descent -> lower intensity but longer-lasting precipitation, with mixed graupel or wet snow.

## Sierra Nevada
- Orographic precipitation:
    - Max orographic band = 1 000–3 000 m on windward (western) flank.
    - Rain shadow = Owens Valley east of crest (< 300 mm yr⁻¹).
- Dry-adiabatic: $ 9.8 \ °C \ km^{-1} $ up to LCL ( $ \approx 1200 \ m $), then saturated rate $ 6 \degree \ C \ km^{-1} $ to 3000 m: $ \Delta T \approx −23 \ \degree C $.  Descent: warms at dry rate:   $ +29 \degree C $ to valley floor.
- Example towns: **Bishop, Lone Pine.**  Both import water via Los Angeles Aqueduct; pumping from deep alluvial fans carefully managed because local recharge is minimal under rain-shadow conditions. [See link.](https://www.ladwp.com/who-we-are/water-system/los-angeles-aqueduct/facts-history)

## Clearing versus Forest Experiment

.code lang:{python}
    .read{python_000_precipitation_chart.py}

Total rainfall: Forest = 140 mm; Pasture = 119 mm ($ \approx  +15 \% $).

####! Possible biases \& fixes:

| Bias / micro-site factor | Likely effect | Mitigation |
|--------------------------|--------------|------------|
| Dense canopy causes **interception loss** before drops reach gauge orifice. | Under-catch at Forest site. | Install *trough* throughfall collectors + stemflow collars to quantify interception; or raise gauge above understory in a tower. |
| **Wind-turbulence** differences: clearing exposed → eddies may enhance Pasture catch. | Over-catch at Pasture. | Equip both gauges with Alter shields, measure local wind speed for correction factors. |
| **Splash-in from drip points** off overhanging leaves near Forest gauge. | Over-catch on intense days, but net effect variable. | Clear 1 m radius around gauge; fit non-splash grid. |

## A 5 Himalayan Catchment
- **Hypsometric method** chosen:
    - Because gauges cluster low (< 1 800 m) yet $ \approx 40 \% $ of basin lies above snowline, rainfall–altitude gradient is strong \& non-linear.  Thiessen would over-weight lowlands; hypsometric belts (e.g., 500 m intervals) allocate snowfall intensities based on elevation and aspect -> better represent orographic input and snow-water storage.
- Supplement **GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) IMERG satellite** or regional weather-radar composites.  Calibrate bias using available gauges; blend with hypsometric zones through kriging or Bias-Corrected Precipitation Reconstruction (BCPR) to refine daily grids.
