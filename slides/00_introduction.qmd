    .box title:{What is this course about} background:{.lightblue}
        - Demonstrate an understanding of the **different components of water** in the landscape and how they interact.
        - Undertake quantitative analysis and interpretation of actual data related to water in Australia.
        - Understand a variety of remote sensing satellite missions and how the observations inform water research.
        - Critically evaluate technical reports and journal articles.
        - Synthesise key concepts in hydrology and/or remote sensing to understand changes in water resources.

# Structure of the course
_Note: The actual content might change depending on our pace_

# Paper Critique

.row gap:{1cm}
  .container width:{50%}
    ## 1. Presentations & Reports
    - Each student presents a selected paper (10-minute talk). (Chosen from a list of papers, first come first serve)
    - Submit a written report ( $ \approx $ 5 pages).

    ---

    ## 2. Engagement
    - Attend all presentations.
    - Ask questions and take notes — these will inform your peer review.


  .container width:{50%}
    ## 3. Peer Review Assignment
    - After all presentations, each student will be assigned a peer to review.
    - Assignments are announced only *after* all talks are completed.

    ---

    ## 4. Peer Review Criteria
    - Use notes and discussion points to guide your evaluation.
    - 50% of grade from instructor's evaluation of your peer review.
    - 50% from your review of the peer's work.
