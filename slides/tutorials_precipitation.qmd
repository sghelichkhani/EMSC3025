    Precipitation

# Precipitation
## The build-up season in the Top End
The late-build-up season in **Darwin, NT**, is a period of oppressive heat and humidity. The temperature only rises a few degrees, but the humidity skyrockets. It does not rain as often as the wet season, but afternoon thunderstorms are frequent:
- List **three atmospheric conditions** that must be satisfied before any of these storms can produce precipitation.
- For each condition, explain (≈ 2 sentences) why failure of that condition would prevent rainfall – even under high relative humidity.

## Warm vs Mixed-Phase Clouds

Convective downpours over **Singapore** in March are dominated by warm-rain processes, whereas December snow-storms in the **Scottish Highlands** rely heavily on the Bergeron ice–crystal mechanism.

- Identify the **dominant droplet-growth mechanism** operating in each region.
- Describe how cloud-temperature structure and up-draught strength favour those mechanisms.
- State one consequence for **raindrop/snow-crystal size distribution at the ground** in each case.

## Sierra Nevada Transect

Fig. 1 shows a west-to-east cross-section across California’s San Jose from the Pacific coast to Bishop. On your copy of the figure, mark:

1. the zone of **maximum orographic precipitation**.
2. the **rain-shadow region**.

- Annotate approximate temperature changes (°C) of a rising unsaturated parcel that moves:
    1. sea-level to 3 000 m. 
    2. crest to Owens Valley floor. (Use the dry- and saturated-adiabatic lapse rates as appropriate.).
    3. (Use your online resources for this:) name **two rain-shadow communities** east of the crest and discuss, in  $ \approx 100 $ words, how this precipitation pattern shapes their water-supply strategies.

## Paired Forest-Pasture Experiment  *(fully hypothetical)*
Two tipping-bucket rain gauges operated for 14 consecutive days (Day 1 – Day 14):
- **Forest-Gauge** mounted 1 m above ground beneath a closed-canopy, mature forest.
- **Pasture-Gauge** sited in an open cattle pasture 600 m away on level terrain.

| Day | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | **Σ 14-d** |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|-----------|
| **Pasture-Gauge (mm)** | 0 | 5 | 12 | 0 | 20 | 8 | 4 | 15 | 9 | 22 | 7 | 17 | 11 | 10 | **140 mm** |
| **Forest-Gauge (mm)**  | 0 | 4 | 9 | 0 | 17 | 7 | 3 | 13 | 8 | 18 | 6 | 15 | 9 | 10 | **119 mm** |
"Daily totals from the 14-day paired-gauge experiment."

1. Draw a **paired bar chart** comparing daily rainfall at the two gauges. The spreadsheet containing the data can be found [here](https://data.gadopt.org/water-course/Paired_Gauges_Table.csv).
2. The Forest-Gauge shows a **15 % lower** 14-day cumulative total than the Pasture-Gauge. Explain **three plausible micro-site or measurement biases** that could produce this difference.
3. For *each* bias, recommend one **practical adjustment or field check** that would reduce its impact in future campaigns.

## Method Evaluation  
A $ 2,500\ km^2 $ catchment in central **Nepal** has four long-term rain gauges, all below $ 1,800\ m\ asl $.  Snowfields begin at $ \approx 3,000 m $ and the crest reaches $ 5,000 m $.

- Select **one** of the following to estimate areal rainfall for monthly water-balance work:
    - Thiessen polygons
    - Hypsometric (altitude-belt) method
- Justify your choice with reference to topography, gauge distribution, and expected precipitation gradients.
- Suggest **one supplementary data source/technology** that could improve the estimate without installing new high-altitude gauges, and explain how you would integrate it.
