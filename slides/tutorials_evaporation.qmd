##! Tut III: Interpreting Evaporation Components

#### Potential and Actual Evaporation
You are given three months of daily climate data (temperature, humidity, radiation, wind) for a small catchment.
- Explain how you would estimate **potential evaporation** ($ E_{pt} $) from this data.
- What key assumptions are you making in the calculation?
- Explain how $ E_{pt} $ relates to actual evaporation, $ E_t $ and how you might evaluate if $ E_t \approx E_{pt} $ for the wet season.

#### Evaporation Dynamics in Soil
A lysimeter experiment was conducted in two neighbouring plots: one bare soil, one vegetated.
- Which plot would you expect to have higher total evaporation over the summer? Why?
- Discuss how **soil moisture** affects actual evaporation in both plots.
- Explain the role of **capillarity** and **transpiration** in the vegetated plot.

#### Vapour Pressure Deficit
Given the following measurements at midday:
| Air Temperature | Relative Humidity | Saturated Vapour Pressure |
|----|----|----|
| $ 25 \degree C $ | 40% | 3.2 kPa |

- Calculate the actual vapour pressure $ e_a $ and the vapour pressure deficit (VPD).
- Briefly describe what this VPD tells us about the potential for evaporation at this time.
- What might plants do in response to this VPD?


####! Comparing Evaporation Measurement Methods
Evaluate the **advantages and limitations** of the following methods for measuring or estimating evaporation in a catchment:
1. Evaporation pans
2. Lysimeters
3. Water balance method
4. Eddy covariance

For each method, comment on:
- The scale (point vs landscape)
- Type of surface (soil, open water, vegetation)
- Key sources of uncertainty


#### The Thornthwaite Method for Estimating Potential Evapotranspiration
**Introduction -** In hydrologic analysis, estimating evaporation is crucial but challenging. While direct measurements using lysimeters provide the most accurate data, these devices are expensive and complex to maintain. In data-sparse regions, empirical models offer practical alternatives. The **Thornthwaite method** is one of the simplest and most widely used approaches, requiring only mean monthly air temperature and geographic latitude to estimate potential evapotranspiration (PET).

The Thornthwaite equation estimates monthly potential evapotranspiration as:

$ E_{pt} = 1.62 \left( \frac{10 T_a}{I} \right)^a $

Where:
- $ E_{pt} $ = estimated potential evapotranspiration (cm/month)
- $ T_a $ = mean monthly air temperature (°C)
- $ I $ = annual heat index (dimensionless)
- $ a $ = empirically derived exponent

<<<

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**

1. **Compute the annual heat index** by summing across all months with $ T_a > 0 $:

   $ I = \sum_{i=1}^{12} \left( \frac{T_{ai}}{5} \right)^{1.5} $

2. **Calculate the exponent** using the cubic polynomial:

   $ a = 0.492 + 0.0119 I - 0.0000771 I^2 + 0.000000675 I^3 $

3. **Apply daylight correction** by multiplying monthly PET by a latitude-dependent factor to account for seasonal variations in day length.

The table below provides daylight correction factors for different latitudes:

#### Exercise: Applying the Thornthwaite Method

**Problem Statement:**

You are tasked with estimating the total potential evapotranspiration for a growing season in Saskatoon, Canada (latitude approximately 52°N). Using the Thornthwaite method, calculate the total PET for the period from May 16 to September 24, 1961.

**Given Data:**

1. Calculate the annual heat index $ I $ using all months with temperatures above 0°C
2. Determine the exponent $ a $ using the cubic polynomial
3. Calculate monthly PET values for May through September
4. Apply appropriate daylight correction factors for latitude 52°N
5. Sum the corrected monthly values to find the total PET for the specified period

**Note:** For the partial months (May 16-31 and September 1-24), you may use the full monthly values or prorate based on the number of days in each period.
