# What is hydrology?
.row
  .container width:{60%}
    - *Hydrology* comes from Greek *hydor* (water) and Latin *logia* (study).
    - Despite the name, it focuses on **fresh water**, not all water.
    - **Oceanography** is the science of saline water.
    - Hydrology examines:
      - Distribution and movement of water
      - Interactions with land, atmosphere, and ecosystems

    .whitespace height:{1cm}

    The oldest known description of water cycle:
    >[...] _precipitation falling in the mountains infiltrated the Earth's surface and led to streams and springs in the lowlands. [...]

# Molecular properties of water
.row
  .container width:{50%}
    - Water: $ H_2O $  two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to oxygen

    - It is a **bipolar molecule**:
      - Positive hydrogen, negative oxygen

    - Bonds:
      - **Covalent** within molecules
      - **Hydrogen** between molecules

    !(40%)[molecule](image/davie_fig_1-1.png "Structure of a water molecule")

  .container width:{50%}
    - Leads to:
      - High **surface tension**
      - Strong **cohesion**
      - Exceptional **solvent** capability

# Physical Properties
.row
   .container width:{50%}
      ## Density
      - Water is most dense at **4°C**
      - Ice is **less dense** → floats on water
      - Implications:
            - Lakes freeze from top-down
            - Aquatic ecosystems persist in cold conditions

      !(80%)[density](image/davie_fig_1-3.png "Water density as a function of temperature")

    .container width:{50%}
      ## Specific Heat
      - Water has **high specific heat capacity** (4.2 kJ/kg/K)
      - Slows temperature change
      - Buffers **climate** and daily temperature swings
      - Comparison with other materials:

      | Substance        | Specific Heat (kJ/kg/K) |
      |------------------|--------------------------|
      | Water            | 4.2                      |
      | Dry soil         | 1.1                      |

      - Solid ↔ Liquid ↔ Gas
    - Processes include:
      - **Melting**, **freezing**
      - **Evaporation**, **condensation**
      - **Sublimation**, **deposition**

# A catchment?
.row
  .container width:{50%}
    - A **catchment** is a land area where surface water drains to a common point
    - Defined by **topographic divides**
    - Used to define **hydrological boundaries**
    - Contains **nested sub-catchments**

  .container width:{50%}
    !(100%)[catchmentmap](image/davie_fig_1-5.png "Catchment boundaries and surface drainage patterns")

# Groundwater vs surface catchments
.row
  .container width:{40%}
    - **Surface water divides** ≠ **groundwater divides**
    - Groundwater can flow across topographic boundaries
    - Important for:
      - **Integrated water resource management**
      - Understanding flow connectivity

# The hydrological cycle
.row
  .container width:{50%}
  	- The **hydrological cycle** describes water movement between Earth and atmosphere as gas, liquid, or solid.
  	- It is a conceptual model — useful but simplified.
  	- Hydrology begins with the **global scale**, then zooms into **catchments**.
  	- Earth's water is mostly in oceans/seas; very little is usable:
  	  - Only **~0.27%** of water is available for human use.

  .container width:{50%}
    !(100%)[HydroCycle](image/internet_hydrocycle.jpg "Different elements of the hydrological cycle")

# Global distribution of water
.row
  .container width:{60%}
  	- Most of Earth's water is stored in:
  	  - Oceans/seas: **96.5%**
  	  - Ice/glaciers: **1.74%**
  	  - Groundwater: **1.69%**
  	- Rivers and lakes make up **tiny fractions** of total volume.

  .container width:{60%}
  	| Storage              | Volume (×10³ km³) | % of total |
  	|----------------------|-------------------|------------|
  	| Oceans/seas          | 1,338,000         | 96.54      |

# Components of the global cycle
.row
  .container width:{50%}
  	- Key global processes:
  	  - **Evaporation** from oceans/lakes
  	  - **Precipitation** over land and sea
  	  - **Run-off** moves water back to oceans
  	- Oceans evaporate more than they receive.
  	- Continents receive more precipitation than they lose.

# Climate zones and water partitioning

.row
  .container width:{40%}
  	- Precipitation is partitioned into:
  	  - **Evaporation**
  	  - **Run-off**
  	  - **Groundwater recharge**
  	- Distribution varies by climate:
  	  - Humid temperate: balanced
  	  - Arid zones: dominated by evaporation

  	!(100%)[climatezones](image/davie_fig_1-8.png "Partitioning of total precipitation by climate zone")


# Water availability vs population
.row
  .container width:{40%}
  	- Per capita water availability is **misleading** if population and use patterns are ignored.
  	- Example: Australia is water-rich by volume but highly variable in space and time.
  	- Effective management depends on **abstraction**, **storage**, and **equity**.

# Water abstraction
.row
  .container width:{30%}
  	- OECD countries vary widely in **water abstraction**.
  	- USA: ~1,730 m³/person/year
  	- Often driven by:
  	  - **Agriculture**
  	  - **Industry**
  	  - **Irrigation infrastructure**
  	- Water use ≠ water availability

  	!(100%)[abstraction](image/davie_fig_1-9.png "Water abstraction per capita for OECD countries")

# The catchment hydrological cycle
.row
  .container width:{30%}
  	- Focuses on processes at **basin scale**:
  	  - **Evaporation**
  	  - **Precipitation**
  	  - **Run-off**
  	- Includes sub-processes:
  	  - Interception
  	  - Transpiration
  	  - Infiltration and through-flow

  .container width:{70%}
  	!(100%)[catchmentcycle](image/davie_fig_1-10.png "Hydrological cycle processes at the catchment scale")

# The water balance equation
.row gap:{1cm}
  .container width:{50%}
  	- The **water balance equation** represents the continuity of water mass in a system.
  	- It quantifies water input, output, and storage over time.
  	-a In its most fundamental form:

    .container width:{100%} alignment:{center} radius:{0.5cm} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.2cm} background:{.lightred}

      $ P \pm E \pm \Delta S \pm Q = 0 $

  	- Often rearranged to estimate **streamflow (Q)**

  	  $ Q = P - E - \Delta S $

  	Where:
  	- $ P $: Precipitation
  	- $ E $: Evaporation
  	- $ \Delta S $: Change in storage
  	- $ Q $: Run-off (or river discharge)

  .container width:{50%}
  	!(100%)[balanceequation](image/internet_waterbalance.jpg "Mass conservation is the primary concept in the water balance equation.")

# Understanding the terms
.row
  .container width:{60%}
  	- The equation includes both **fluxes** and **stores**:
  	  - **Fluxes**: $ P $, $ E $, $ Q $
  	  - **Store**: $ \Delta S $ (soil, groundwater, snow)
  	- Each term may be:
  	  - **Positive** (gain) — e.g. precipitation
  	  - **Negative** (loss) — e.g. evaporation or outflow
  	- Storage can increase or decrease depending on the balance.

  .container width:{40%}
  	- Used widely in:
  	  - **Catchment hydrology**
  	  - **Water resource models**
  	  - **Climate impact studies**
  	- Knowing three of the four terms allows you to estimate the fourth.
  	- Example:
  	  If $ P = 100 $, $ E = 40 $, $ \Delta S = 10 $, then
  	  $ Q = 100 - 40 - 10 = 50 $


# Challenges in practice
.row
  .container width:{60%}
  	- Difficulties in application include:
  	  - **Spatial variability** in rainfall
  	  - **Temporal mismatch** in data resolution
  	  - Estimating $ \Delta S $ is often hard
  	- Hydrological **models** often use the water balance to simulate run-off.
  	- Model example:
  	  Input daily rainfall and evaporation to calculate daily discharge using:
  	  $ Q = P - E - \Delta S $

  .container width:{40%}

# Magnitude–frequency–duration
.row
  .container width:{40%}
  	- Hydrological events vary by:
  	  - **Magnitude** (e.g. rainfall depth)
  	  - **Frequency** (how often)
  	  - **Duration** (how long)
  	- Frequency histograms help visualize event rarity
  	- Important for flood design and infrastructure planning

  	- Probability:
  	  $ p = \frac{n}{N} $
  	- Recurrence interval = \( 1/p \)
  	- A 1% chance event = 1-in-100-year event
  	- Recurrence ≠ prediction of exact timing
  	- Used for rainfall design curves and flood risk estimation

  .container width:{60%}
  	!(100%)[flowfrequency](image/davie_fig_1-11.png "Flow magnitude and frequency in River Boyd catchment")


# Duration and design rainfall
.row
  .container width:{40%}
  	- Magnitude–frequency–duration (MFD) curves relate:
  	  - **Rainfall depth**
  	  - **Storm duration**
  	  - **Event rarity**
  	- Longer durations require more rainfall to be "rare"
  	- Used to develop **intensity–duration–frequency (IDF)** charts
