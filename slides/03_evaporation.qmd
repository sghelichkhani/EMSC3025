# Evaporation

            Transfer of liquid water into gasious state into the atmosphere

        Evaportation's importance is mainly affected by two factors:
        - The amount of available energy
        - Available water

        Both of these are modulated by .emph{climate}.
        Think of cases where evaporation might not be as important:
        - Humid climate in winter: much water but **limited energy**
        - Arid climate in dry season: much energy but **limited water**

# Different Definitions of Evaportaion
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{50%}
        .box title:{Evaportaion} background:{.lightblue}
            - **Open water Evaporation**, $ E_O $: Evaportation above a
            body of water such as lakes, streams, oceans. As can be see in
            global water cycle figure, largest source of evaporation.
            - **Potential Evaporation**, $ E_{pt} $ : Amount of evaportation above land if there was unlimited water.
            - **Total Evaportation**, $ B_t $:  This is the actual evaportation. Wet seasons: $ E_t \approx E_{pt} $

        .align{center}
            We are mostly interested in $ E_O $ and $ E_t $, but $ E_{pt} $ gives us a good indicator of what $ E_t $ might be.

        Transpiration is the result of photosynthesis and respiration in the plants.
        - It is controled by the ability of the leafs in openning or closing of the leafs stomata in response to vapour pressure difference.
        - It is further control by amount of water, the soild, the ability of plants to tranfer water to the leaves.

    .container width:{50%}
        .box type:{warning} background:{.lightblue}
            We are considering evaporation as a negative source. But water lost, is just transferred to the atmosphere. A meteorologist would consider evaporation as
            a positive source and dewafll as a negative one.


# Evaporation as a process

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{70%}
        _Dalton_ (1766-1844): The English physicist was the first to recognise the relationship between wind, air dryness, and evaporation

        **Formula:** $ E = C (e_x - e_a) $

        **Where:**
        - $ E $ — Evaporation rate.
        - $ e_x $ — Vapor pressure at the water surface.
        - $ eₐ $ — Vapor pressure of the surrounding air.
        - $ C $ — Empirical constant (depends on wind, temperature, etc.).

        **Key Idea**: Evaporation increases with the difference in vapor pressure between the water surface and the air.

# Available Energy

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{50%}
        Main source of energy is from the sun. Sun's radiation is filtered by the clouds, water vapour and absorbed by trees and tall buildings.

        $ Q^{\ast} = Q_S \pm Q_L \pm Q_G $

        - $ Q^{\ast} $: net radiation
        - $ Q_S $: Sun's direct radiation (Short wave), heat we feel as warmth
        - $ Q_L $: Latent heat due to change in phase. $ Q_L < 0 $ when Water --> Gas, $ Q_L > 0 $ when Gas --> Water.
        - $ Q_G $: Energy absorbed and released from the soil.

        Two other sources of energy that _might_ become important:
        - In urban settings, energy released from buildings  in cold winters. From organic sources of energy.
        - Advective heat: As introduced in [introduction](./00_introduction/text.html)

# Water supply and evaporation

.row
    .container width:{50%} alignment:{center}
        - Over the **oceans**, water supply is effectively unlimited, making evaporation a major component of the hydrological cycle.
        - On **land**, water availability varies:
            - **Open water evaporation** ($ E_o $) occurs from lakes, rivers, ponds
            - **Soil evaporation** is more complex and limite
    .container width:{50%}
        - In soils:
            - Water evaporates from the **near surface**
            - A **moisture gradient** forms, pulling water upward
            - This upward movement must overcome **gravity** and **soil capillarity**
        - Plants also draw water to the surface via **osmosis** in their roots.
        - The relationship between **soil moisture** and evaporation is dynamic and will be revisited later.

# Vapour pressure deficit

.row
    .container width:{50%} alignment:{center}
        - Evaporation depends on the difference between:
          - $ e_s $: saturated vapour pressure
          - $ e_a $: actual vapour pressure
        - The difference $ (e_s - e_a) $ is the **vapour pressure deficit (vpd)**.
        - Higher VPD → higher potential for evaporation
        - Relative humidity is the ratio $ e_a / e_s $

# Open-water versus soil evaporation

.row
  .container width:{50%}
    ##! Open water evaporation
    - The simplest case: evaporation from **lakes, rivers, reservoirs**
    - Controlled by:
      - Water body properties (temp, salinity, depth)
      - Atmosphere above (vpd and mixing)
    - Often **overestimates** evaporation in catchments due to unlimited water supply

  .container width:{50%}
    ##! Soil evaporation
    - Same process as open water, but:
      - **Water supply is limited**
      - Water must move up through the soil
    - Influenced by:
      - Soil saturation and capillarity
      - Surface conditions (e.g. bare vs vegetated)



# Transpiration and total evaporation

.row
  .container width:{40%}
    - Transpiration = water loss via **stomata in leaves**
    - Plants respond to:
      - Water availability
      - VPD (they close stomata under stress)
    - **Evapotranspiration (ET)** combines:
      - Soil evaporation
      - Transpiration
      - Canopy interception loss

# Measuring evaporation is hard

.row
  .container width:{60%}
    ##!
    - No gauge can directly capture **evaporated vapour**
    - Many methods estimate evaporation **indirectly** via:
      - Energy balance
      - Water balance
      - Micrometeorological measurements
    - All methods make assumptions about **fluxes and gradients**

  .container width:{60%}
    ##! Direct micro-meteorological methods
    - Require **high-frequency measurements**, since wind speed, humidity, and temperature are highly variable
    - Three techniques:
      - Eddy covariance
      - Aerodynamic profile
      - Bowen ratio


# Indirect: water balance methods

.row
  .container width:{60%}
    - Evaporation can be inferred from the **water balance**:

      $ E = \Delta S - P $

    - Use a pan or lysimeter where:
      - $ \Delta S $ = change in water volume
      - $ P $ = precipitation

    - Good for **controlled setups**, less reliable in field conditions

  .container width:{40%}
    ![Water balance](image/davie_fig_3-3.png "")

# Evaporation pans

.row
  .container width:{60%}
    - Large containers filled with water, exposed to the atmosphere
    - Record water loss over time
    - Limitations:
      - Overestimate actual $ E $
      - Suffer from **edge effect** and radiation bias
      - Used mostly for **open water** or **reservoirs**

  .container width:{40%}
    !(100%)[evappan](image/davie_fig_3-3.png "An evaporation pan. This sits above the surface (to lessen rain splash) and has either an instrument to record water depth or a continuous weighing device, to measure changes in volume.")

# Lysimeters

.row
  .container width:{50%}
    - Measure $ E $ over **vegetated surfaces**
    - Mimic soil and vegetation — allow **percolation**
    - Use:

      $ E = \Delta S - P - Q $

      where $ Q $ = drainage

    - Can be weighed or monitored using load cells
    - Most accurate field method, but:
      - Small scale
      - Expensive and complex

# Summary
.align{center}
    .container width:{60%} alignment:{center}
        .box title:{So here we covered that:} background:{.lightblue}
            - Evaporation transfers water to the atmosphere, driven by energy and water availability.
            - Types include open water ($ E_o $), potential ($ E_{pt} $), and actual ($ E_t $).
            - Transpiration from plants adds to total evapotranspiration.
            - **VPD** (vapour pressure deficit) is a key driver of evaporation.
            - Measured via _direct_(lysimeters) and indirect (pans, water balance) methods.
