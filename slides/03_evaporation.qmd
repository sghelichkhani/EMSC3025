            Transfer of liquid water into gaseous state into the atmosphere

        evaporation's importance is mainly affected by two factors:
          1. .fragment behavior:{show} content:{The amount of available energy}
          2. .fragment behavior:{show} content:{Available water}

        Both of these are modulated by .ul{climate}.
        Think of cases where evaporation might not be as important:
        - .fragment content:{Humid climate in winter: much water but **limited energy**}
        - .fragment content:{Arid climate in dry season: much energy but **limited water**}

# Different Definitions of Evaporation
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{50%}
        .box title:{Evaporation} background:{.lightblue}
            - **Open water Evaporation**, $ E_O $: Evaporation above a
            body of water such as lakes, streams, oceans. As can be see in
            global water cycle figure, largest source of evaporation.
            - **Potential Evaporation**, $ E_{pt} $ : Amount of evaporation above land if there was unlimited water.
            - **Total Evaporation**, $ B_t $:  This is the actual evaporation. Wet seasons: $ E_t \approx E_{pt} $

        .center
            - We are mostly interested in $ E_O $ and $ E_t $, but $ E_{pt} $ gives us a good indicator of what $ E_t $ might be.
            - Fig. 2 -> Global Water Cycle, $ E_0 $ dominates the global component of evaporation

        Transpiration is the result of photosynthesis and respiration in the plants. It is controlled by:
        - .fragment content:{... the ability of the leafs in opening or closing of the leafs stomata in response to vapour pressure difference.}
        - .fragment content:{... further by amount of water, the solid, the ability of plants to transfer water to the leaves.}

    .container width:{50%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.1cm} background:{.lightblue}
      We are considering evaporation as a negative source. But water lost, is just transferred to the atmosphere. A meteorologist would consider evaporation as
      a positive source and dewafll as a negative one.

# Understanding Transpiration
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{50%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
        - **Effect on Local Weather:**
            - Increases **heat index**: feels hotter with added humidity.
            - High humidity can stress humans by hindering sweat evaporation.
            - **Night time temperatures** stay warmer due to high humidity.

        - **Seasonal and Regional Impact:**
            - Most impactful during hot summer months.
            - Affects areas near agricultural hubs like:
              - .fragment content:{.ul{cornfields -> corn sweat}}

# Corn Sweat:

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{50%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
         A common phenomenon in summer in US midwest
          - Millions of acres of cornfields add moisture to the air.
          - One acre can release 3,000-4,000 gallons of water per day.
          - Iowa's cornfields could add 40.5 billion gallons of water daily.

# Evaporation as a process

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{70%}
        _Dalton_ (1766-1844): The English physicist was the first to recognise the relationship between wind, air dryness, and evaporation

        **Formula:** $ E = C (e_x - e_a) $

        **Where:**
        - $ E $ — Evaporation rate.
        - $ e_x $ — Vapour pressure at the water surface.
        - $ e_a $ — Vapour pressure of the surrounding air.
        - $ C $ — Empirical constant (depends on wind, temperature, etc.).

        **Key Idea**: Evaporation increases with the difference in vapour pressure between the water surface and the air.

# Available Energy

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{50%}
        Main source of energy is from the sun. Sun's radiation is filtered by the clouds, water vapour and absorbed by trees and tall buildings.

        $ Q^{\ast} = Q_S \pm Q_L \pm Q_G $

        - $ Q^{\ast} $: net radiation
        - $ Q_S $: Sun's direct radiation (Short wave), heat we feel as warmth
        - $ Q_L $: Latent heat due to change in phase. $ Q_L < 0 $ when Water --> Gas, $ Q_L > 0 $ when Gas --> Water.
        - $ Q_G $: Energy absorbed and released from the soil.

        Two other sources of energy that _might_ become important:
        - .fragment content:{In urban settings, energy released from buildings  in cold winters. From organic sources of energy.}
        - .fragment content:{Advective heat: As introduced in [introduction](https://water-course.github.io/content/Watercycle/index.html)}

# Water supply and evaporation

.row
    .container width:{50%} alignment:{center}
        - Over the **oceans**, water supply is effectively unlimited, making evaporation a major component of the hydrological cycle.
        - On **land**, water availability varies:
            - **Open water evaporation** ($ E_o $) occurs from lakes, rivers, ponds.
            - **Soil evaporation** is more complex and limited by water availability.
    .container width:{50%}
        - In soils:
            - Water evaporates from the **near surface**
            - A **moisture gradient** forms, pulling water upward
            - This upward movement must overcome **gravity** and **soil capillarity**
        - Plants also draw water to the surface via **osmosis** in their roots.

# The receiving atmosphere

.row
    .container width:{50%} alignment:{center}
        - Once the water is evaporated, it diffuses into the atmosphere.
        - Evaporation depends on the difference between:
          - $ e_s $: saturated vapour pressure
          - $ e_a $: actual vapour pressure
        - The difference $ (e_s - e_a) $ is the **vapour pressure deficit (vpd)** or **saturation deficit**.
        - Higher VPD → higher potential for evaporation
        - Relative humidity is the ratio $ e_a / e_s $
        - Note that mixing is very important to provide more capacity for evaporation.

# .ul{Open-water} versus .ul{soil} evaporation

.row
  .container width:{50%}
    ##! Open water evaporation
    - The simplest case: evaporation from **lakes, rivers, reservoirs**
    - Controlled by:
      - Water body properties (temp, salinity, depth)
      - Atmosphere above (vpd and mixing)
    - Often **overestimates** evaporation in catchments due to unlimited water supply

  .container width:{50%}
    ##! Soil evaporation
    - Same process as open water, but:
      - **Water supply is limited**
      - Water must move up through the soil
    - Influenced by:
      - Soil saturation and capillarity
      - Surface conditions (e.g. bare vs vegetated)



# Transpiration and total evaporation

.row
  .container width:{40%}
    - Transpiration = water loss via **stomata in leaves**
    - Plants respond to:
      - Water availability
      - VPD (they close stomata under stress)
    - **Evapotranspiration (ET)** combines:
      - Soil evaporation
      - Transpiration
      - Canopy interception loss

# Measuring evaporation is hard

.row
  .container width:{60%}
    ##!
    - No gauge can directly capture **evaporated vapour**
    - Many methods estimate evaporation **indirectly** via:
      - Energy balance
      - Water balance
      - Micro-meteorological measurements
    - All methods make assumptions about **fluxes and gradients**

  .container width:{60%}
    ##! Direct micro-meteorological methods
    - Require **high-frequency measurements**, since wind speed, humidity, and temperature are highly variable
    - Three techniques:
      - Eddy covariance
      - Aerodynamic profile
      - Bowen ratio

# Direct: Eddy covariance
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
        - **Eddy Covariance (Turbulence) Method**
        - **Principle:** Directly measures turbulent fluxes by computing the covariance between vertical wind velocity and scalar quantities (e.g., temperature or vapor).
        - **Equations:**
            - $H = \rho c_p \overline{w'T'}$ (sensible heat flux)
            - $\lambda E = \lambda \rho \overline{w'q'}$ (latent heat flux)
        - **Data Needs:** High-frequency (10–20 Hz) 3D wind and scalar measurements.
        - **Assumptions:** Stationarity, homogeneous surface.
        - **Pros:** Most accurate and direct method; no need for gradient assumptions.
        - **Cons:** Expensive; complex instruments and processing; sensitive to sensor alignment, data gaps, and surface heterogeneity.

# Direct: Aerodynamic profile (Flux-Gradient)
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
        - **Aerodynamic Profiling (Flux-Gradient) Method**
        - **Principle:** Based on Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST) to relate vertical gradients of wind, temperature, and humidity to turbulent fluxes.
        - **Key Inputs:** Profiles of wind speed, temperature, humidity; roughness length; stability corrections.
        - **Assumptions:** Stationarity, horizontally homogeneous surface, valid MOST conditions.
        - **Pros:** Useful in many micrometeorological settings.
        - **Cons:** Requires accurate profile data; sensitive to stability corrections and roughness parameters.

# Direct: Bowen ratio
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
        - **Bowen Ratio Method**
        - **Principle:** Uses measured temperature and humidity gradients between two heights to infer latent and sensible heat fluxes.
        - **Key Variable:** Bowen ratio $\beta = H/\lambda E$, where $H$ is sensible and $\lambda E$ is latent heat flux.
        - **Data Needs:** Two levels of temperature and humidity, net radiation, ground heat flux.
        - **Assumptions:** Steady state, negligible horizontal advection, similarity of turbulent transfer of heat and moisture.
        - **Pros:** Low cost; easy to maintain.
        - **Cons:** Unreliable when gradients are small or near zero.

# Indirect: water balance methods
.row
  .container width:{60%}
    - Evaporation can be inferred from the **water balance**:

      $ E = \Delta S - P $

    - Use a pan or lysimeter where:
      - $ \Delta S $ = change in water volume
      - $ P $ = precipitation

    - Good for **controlled setups**, less reliable in field conditions

  .container width:{40%}
    ![Water balance](image/davie_fig_3-3.png "")

# Evaporation pans

.row
  .container width:{60%}
    - Large containers filled with water, exposed to the atmosphere
    - Record water loss over time
    - Limitations:
      - Overestimate actual $ E $
      - Suffer from **edge effect** and radiation bias
      - Used mostly for **open water** or **reservoirs**

  .container width:{40%}
    !(100%)[evappan](image/davie_fig_3-3.png "An evaporation pan. This sits above the surface (to lessen rain splash) and has either an instrument to record water depth or a continuous weighing device, to measure changes in volume.")

# Lysimeters

.row
  .container width:{50%}
    - Measure $ E $ over **vegetated surfaces**
    - Mimic soil and vegetation — allow **percolation**
    - Use:

      $ E = \Delta S - P - Q $

      where $ Q $ = drainage

    - Can be weighed or monitored using load cells
    - Most accurate field method, but:
      - Small scale
      - Expensive and complex

# Summary
.align{center}
    .container width:{60%} alignment:{center}
        .box title:{So here we covered that:} background:{.lightblue}
            - Evaporation transfers water to the atmosphere, driven by energy and water availability.
            - Types include open water ($ E_o $), potential ($ E_{pt} $), and actual ($ E_t $).
            - Transpiration from plants adds to total evapotranspiration.
            - **VPD** (vapour pressure deficit) is a key driver of evaporation.
            - Measured via _direct_(lysimeters) and indirect (pans, water balance) methods.
