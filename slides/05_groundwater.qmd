# Porosity of a Soil or Rock

.row
  .container width:{50%}
    - **Porosity** describes how much void space exists in a rock or soil—essentially, how much room is available to hold water.
    - Groundwater resides in the pores of rocks and sediments.
    - **Total porosity** $ n_T $ is defined as:

      $ n_T = \frac{V_v}{V_T} = \frac{V_T - V_s}{V_T} $

      where:
      - $ V_v $ = volume of voids
      - $ V_s $ = volume of solids
      - $ V_T $ = total volume
    - Typical values of $ n_T $:
      - Sand and gravel: 0.25 – 0.35
      - Cemented sandstones: 0.05 – 0.15

# Porosity and Bulk Density

.row
  .container width:{50%}
    - Porosity can also be calculated using **bulk density**:

      $ n_T = 1 - \frac{\rho_b}{\rho_s} $

      where:
      - $ \rho_b $ = bulk density (mass/volume of dry sample)
      - $ \rho_s $ = particle density (mass/volume of solids)
    - This approach is common in lab settings where volume and mass can be measured directly.

    It is also useful to distinguish:
    - **Primary porosity**: original voids formed during rock/soil formation (e.g., in sediments, vesicles in lava).
    - **Secondary porosity**: formed later, e.g., via fractures, faults, or dissolution in carbonates.

  .container width:{40%}
    !(100%)[Types of Porosity](image/internet_porosity_primarysecondary.png "Primary vs Secondary Porosity")


# Factors Affecting Porosity

.row
  .container width:{40%}
    - **Primary porosity** depends on:
      - **Compaction**: tighter packing = lower porosity
      - **Grain shape and arrangement**: more spherical = less compact = higher porosity
      - **Sorting**:
        - Well-sorted sediments (uniform size) → higher porosity
        - Poorly sorted (mixed sizes) → smaller grains fill the voids
    - **Porosity ranges**:
      - 0 to >50% depending on material
      - Unlithified materials (e.g. sand) >> lithified ones (e.g. sandstone)

    Good sorting and less compaction = more room for groundwater.

  .container width:{60%}
    !(100%)[Sorting and Porosity](image/franklin_fig_3-2.png "Sections of four contiguous spheres of equal size: (a) the most compact arrangement, lowest porosity; (b) less compact arrangement, higher porosity; (c) least compact arrangement, highest porosity")


# Porosity in Natural Materials

.row
  .container width:{40%}
    - For **unlithified materials**:
      - **Smaller grain size** → higher porosity (e.g. clays > sands)
      - Glacial till is variable (mixtures of sand/silt/clay + varying compaction)
    - **Sandstone**:
      - Porosity reduced by cementation
    - **Carbonates (e.g., limestone, dolomite)**:
      - Diagenesis and reactivity make porosity highly variable
    - **Igneous rocks**: low primary porosity
    - **Fractured rocks**:
      - Have **dual porosity**: matrix + fractures
      - Fractures provide **secondary porosity** essential for flow

    Never judge porosity by rock type alone—structure and history matter.

Block (a) is several millimeters wide and shows primary porosity for unlithified sand. Blocks (b, c) are larger potential meters to 10s of meters in width. For granite (b), secondary porosity created by fracturing facilitates flow. Block (c) illustrates caverns in limestone produced by solution-enhanced enlargements of fractures.")


# Effective Porosity and Dual Porosity Systems

.row
  .container width:{50%}
    - **Effective porosity**: fraction of pore space that actually contributes to flow
      - Often < total porosity (Not all the pores are connected)
      - Especially important in fractured or poorly connected media
    - **Fractured media** (e.g. shales, granite):
      - Matrix may store water, but fractures control flow
      - Fracture porosity $n_f$ for shale: ~0.05 or less
    - **Dual porosity** systems:
      - Primary: matrix porosity
      - Secondary: fractures, dissolution features (e.g. caverns in limestone)
    - Porosity must be paired with **permeability** (up next!) to understand flow.

# Occurrence of Groundwater

.row
  .container width:{50%}
    - Water in the subsurface occupies **pores** in soil and rock.
    - **Unsaturated zone**: pores contain both air and water
      - Water content fluctuates with infiltration and evapotranspiration
      - Plants use this water
    - **Saturated zone**: pores are fully water-filled — this is **groundwater**
    - The **water table** separates the two zones
    - A small portion of rain infiltrates deep enough to reach the water table → **recharge**

    Water in the ground isn’t just “there”—it’s dynamic and layered.

  .container width:{50%}
    !(100%)[franklin_fig_3-4.png](image/franklin_fig_3-4.png "Recharge, unsaturated zone, and water table")

# Flow of Groundwater

.row
  .container width:{40%}
    - After recharge, groundwater flows:
      - **Downward** from water table due to gravity
      - **Sideways** following pressure gradients, often toward streams
    - This flow forms **discharge** zones (e.g. rivers, springs)
    - Example: Rain → infiltration → percolation → river discharge
    - **Timescales vary**:
      - Surface runoff = hours
      - Groundwater discharge = months to years
    - Flow influenced by:
      - Water table shape
      - Conductivity of subsurface materials

    Flow is slow, deep, and essential to sustaining surface water.

# Darcy’s Law: The Foundations

.row
  .container width:{60%}
    - **Henry Darcy** (1800s) studied water filtration and developed an empirical law for groundwater flow.
    - Darcy’s experiments showed that **flow depends on energy differences**:
      - Water moves from **high to low gravitational energy**
      - Like a drop on a slide — higher up means more potential energy
    - Energy loss over distance gives rise to the **hydraulic gradient**:

      $ i = \frac{e_{top} - e_{bot}}{\Delta l} $

    - This principle forms the core of Darcy’s Law.

  .container width:{40%}
    !(100%)[franklin_fig_3-6.png](image/franklin_fig_3-6.png "Water flows downhill due to gravitational energy")

# Hydraulic Gradient and Energy Slope

.row
  .container width:{50%}
    - **Gradient** = energy change per unit length of flow path
    - In groundwater terms:
      - Energy is **hydraulic head** (gravitational + pressure)
      - Steeper gradient → faster potential flow
    - Flow rate increases with:
      - Greater difference in head
      - Shorter flow distance
    - Key analogy: **sliding down a playground slide**
      - Steeper slide → faster slide

    The gradient controls the force pushing water through pores.

    !(60%)[gradient_slide.png](image/internet_slide.jpg "Gravitational energy slope analogy")

# Hydraulic Conductivity

.row
  .container width:{50%}
    - Not all materials transmit water equally well.
    - **Hydraulic conductivity** ($K$) quantifies this:
      - High $ K $ → gravel, coarse sand
      - Low $ K $ → clay, unfractured rock
    - Units: length per time (e.g. m/day)
    - $ K $ depends on:
      - Pore size and connectivity
      - Fluid properties (viscosity, density)

    Even with the same gradient, **some materials flow better than others**.

  .container width:{50%}
    !(100%)[franklin_fig_3-7.png](image/franklin_fig_3-7.png "Darcy’s column experiment setup")


# Darcy’s Equation

.row
  .container width:{50%}
    - Darcy combined gradient ($ i $) and material property ($ K $) to describe flow:

      $ q = -K i \tag{3.6} $

      - $q$: Darcy velocity (aka specific discharge), volumetric flow per area

    - Alternate form using cross-sectional area $ A $:

      $ Q = -K i A \tag{3.7} $

    - Negative sign: flow goes from high head to low head
    - Valid for **laminar flow** in porous media

    Darcy’s Law is **foundational** to all groundwater flow modeling.

  .container width:{50%}
    !(100%)[darcy_column.png](image/franklin_fig_3-7.png "Q and h measured along a porous column")

# Linear (Pore) Velocity

.row
  .container width:{50%}
    - **Darcy velocity** ($q$) assumes flow spreads over the whole cross section
    - But in reality, water only flows through **connected pores**
    - True or **pore velocity** ($ v $) is:

      $ v = \frac{q}{n_e} $

      where:
      - $ n_e $: effective porosity (only connected pore space)
      - $ q $: Darcy velocity

    - Since $ n_e < 1 $, pore velocity is **greater** than Darcy velocity
    - Rearranged Darcy's Law:

      $ v = -\frac{K}{n_e} \cdot \frac{h_1 - h_2}{\Delta l} \tag{3.9} $

    This gives the **actual speed** water travels through aquifers.

# Components of Hydraulic Head

.row
  .container width:{70%}
    - **Hydraulic head** is a measure of energy available to move groundwater
    - It is expressed in units of **length** (e.g., m above sea level)
    - In the field, head is measured with a **standpipe** or piezometer
    - Key components:
      - Elevation of top of casing ($EL_{TOC}$)
      - Depth to water ($DTW$)

    - The head is calculated by:

      $ h = EL_{TOC} - DTW $

    Measuring head tells us the **direction and gradient** of groundwater flow.

# Components of Hydraulic Head II

.row
  .container width:{60%}
    - Hydraulic head consists of:
      - **Elevation head** ($ z $): height above datum
      - **Pressure head** ($ P/\rho_w g $): height of water column exerting pressure
      - **Velocity head**: often negligible in groundwater

    - General form (Bernoulli):

      $ h = z + \frac{P}{\rho_w g} + \frac{v^2}{2g} $

    - Simplified form (no velocity term):

      $ h = z + \frac{P}{\rho_w g} $

    - Units: meters (m)
    - Pressure (Pa) can be converted from depth of water:

      $ P = \rho_w g (h - z) $

# Hydraulic Conductivity

.row
  .container width:{50%}
    - **Hydraulic conductivity** is a measure of how easily water flows through porous material
    - Denoted by $ K $, it appears in Darcy’s Law:

      $ q = -K \frac{dh}{dl} $

    - Units of $ K $ are velocity (e.g. m/day)
    - High $ K $: sand, gravel
    - Low $ K $: clay, shale
    - $ K $ depends on:
      - Properties of the **medium**
      - Properties of the **fluid** (density, viscosity)

    Hydraulic conductivity is widely used in field hydrogeology.

   .container width:{50%}
        - **Intrinsic permeability** $ k $ characterizes the medium only:
          - Independent of fluid type
          - Units: $ \mathrm{m}^2 $, also expressed in **darcy** or **cm²**
        - Darcy’s Law rewritten:

          $ q = -\frac{k \, \rho_w g}{\mu} \, \frac{dh}{dl} $

        - Conversion to hydraulic conductivity:

          $ K = \frac{k \, \rho_w g}{\mu} $

        - At 20°C and 1 atm:

          $ K = 9.77 \times 10^6 \cdot k $

        - Or:

          $ k = (1.023 ) \times 10^{-7} \, \mathrm{m \cdot sec}) \cdot K $

        Use $ k $ for comparisons across different fluids.

# Experimental Determination of Hydraulic Conductivity
##! Constant-Head Test

.row
  .container width:{70%}
  	- Used for **coarse-grained** materials (e.g. sands, gravels)
  	- A steady flow is established by maintaining a **constant head difference** across the sample
  	- Flow rate $ Q $ is measured at the outlet
  	- Hydraulic conductivity $ K $ is calculated as:

  	  $ K = \frac{Q L}{A h} $

  	  where:
  	  - $ L $ = sample length
  	  - $ A $ = cross-sectional area
  	  - $ h $ = constant head difference

  	Works best when $ Q $ is large and easily measured.

# Experimental Determination of Hydraulic Conductivity
##! Falling-Head Test

.row
  .container width:{70%}
  	- Preferred for **fine-grained** or **less permeable** materials (e.g. clays, silts)
  	- No continuous flow: water level in standpipe drops over time
  	- Measure time $ t_1 - t_0 $ for water head to fall from $ h_0 $ to $ h_1 $
  	- Hydraulic conductivity:

  	  $ K = 2.3 \, \frac{a L}{A (t_1 - t_0)} \log_{10} \left( \frac{h_0}{h_1} \right) $

  	  where:
  	  - $ a $ = standpipe cross-section
  	  - $ A $ = sample cross-section

  	Falling-head is more accurate for slow flows and low $ K $.

# Anisotropic Flow and Darcy’s Law

.row
  .container width:{100%}
  	- In **anisotropic materials**, hydraulic conductivity depends on direction.
  	- Darcy’s Law becomes a **vector-tensor** equation:

  	  $ \mathbf{q} = - \mathbf{K} \nabla h $

  	- In Cartesian form:

  	  $ \mathbf{q} = q_x \mathbf{i} + q_y \mathbf{j} + q_z \mathbf{k} $

  	  $ \nabla h = \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} \mathbf{i} + \frac{\partial h}{\partial y} \mathbf{j} + \frac{\partial h}{\partial z} \mathbf{k} $

  	- The hydraulic conductivity tensor is:

  	  $ \mathbf{K} = \begin{bmatrix} K_{xx} & K_{xy} & K_{xz} \\ K_{yx} & K_{yy} & K_{yz} \\ K_{zx} & K_{zy} & K_{zz} \end{bmatrix} $

  	These terms describe how flow in one direction may be influenced by gradients in others.

  .container width:{100%}
  	!(100%)[Anisotropic flow](image/internet_anisotropy.png "Anisotropic diffusivity makes material move with different velocities in different directions.")


# Darcy Velocity Components

.row
  .container width:{100%}
  	- For anisotropic flow, each component of flow is influenced by **multiple gradients**:

  	  $ q_x = -K_{xx} \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} - K_{xy} \frac{\partial h}{\partial y} - K_{xz} \frac{\partial h}{\partial z} $
  	  $ q_y = -K_{yx} \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} - K_{yy} \frac{\partial h}{\partial y} - K_{yz} \frac{\partial h}{\partial z} $
  	  $ q_z = -K_{zx} \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} - K_{zy} \frac{\partial h}{\partial y} - K_{zz} \frac{\partial h}{\partial z} $

  	- If the medium is **aligned with coordinate axes**, then off-diagonal terms vanish:

  	  $ K_{xy} = K_{yx} = K_{xz} = K_{zx} = K_{yz} = K_{zy} = 0 $

  	- This simplifies to:

  	  $ q_x = -K_{xx} \frac{\partial h}{\partial x}, \quad q_y = -K_{yy} \frac{\partial h}{\partial y}, \quad q_z = -K_{zz} \frac{\partial h}{\partial z} $

  	This is common in layered sedimentary rocks where horizontal and vertical conductivities differ.

# Anisotropy in Sedimentary Rocks

.row
  .container width:{40%}
  	- Field and lab studies confirm many rocks are **anisotropic**
  	- Horizontal conductivity is often **orders of magnitude** greater than vertical
  	- This affects:
  	  - Recharge and discharge zones
  	  - Aquifer drawdown patterns
  	  - Contaminant transport direction

  	Below are typical values from core samples:

# Heterogeneous Hydraulic Conductivity

.row
  .container width:{50%}
  	- A medium is **homogeneous** if permeability is constant within it.
  	- If permeability varies across space, it is **heterogeneous**.
  	- A common model: **layered medium** with different $ K_{hi} $, $ K_{vi} $, and thicknesses $ b_i $
  	- For $ M $ horizontal layers, the **equivalent horizontal conductivity** is:

  	  $ K_h = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^M b_i K_{hi} }{ \sum_{i=1}^M b_i } $

  	- This is a **thickness-weighted average**.
  	- Horizontal conductivity dominates in flow parallel to bedding.

# Vertical Flow and Flow Refraction

.row
  .container width:{40%}
  	- In vertical direction, **equivalent conductivity** is given by:

  	  $ K_v = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^M b_i }{ \sum_{i=1}^M \frac{b_i}{K_{vi}} } $

  	- This is a **harmonic average** — low $ K_{vi} $ dominates vertical resistance.
  	- When groundwater crosses a boundary between layers, it refracts.

  	- **Refraction law**:

  	  $ \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{\tan(\alpha_1)}{\tan(\alpha_2)} $

  	- The angle of flow changes based on contrast in hydraulic conductivity across boundary.
