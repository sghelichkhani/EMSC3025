<!--
If a body of warm, moist air is cooled then it will become saturated with water
vapour and eventually the water vapour will condense into liquid or solid water (i.e. water or ice
droplets). The water will not condense spontaneously however; there need to be minute particles
present in the atmosphere, called condensation nuclei, upon which the water or ice droplets form.
The water or ice droplets that form on condensation nuclei are normally too small to fall to the
surface as precipitation; they need to grow in order to have enough mass to overcome uplifting
forces within a cloud.

# Conditions for Precipitation

###! .emph{Precipitation:} The release of water from the atmosphere to reach the surface of the Earth.
.align{center}
    Covers all forms of water: **snow**, **hail**, **sleet**, and **rainfall**.\
    The ability of air to hold water vapour is .emph{temperature} dependent.

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{40%}
        Three physical conditions must be met for precipitation to occur:
        - **Cooling** of the atmosphere
        - **Condensation** onto atmospheric nuclei
        - **Growth** of water/ice droplets large enough to overcome updrafts

            - Rising air expands and cools (Adiabatic lapse rate)
            - For dry air: negative of the rate of temperature change with altitude:

# Atmospheric Cooling Mechanisms

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{40%} height:{100%}
        Cooling is essential for condensation and precipitation:
        - Rising air expands and cools (Boyle’s Law)
        - Main causes of uplift:
            - .emph{Convective}: surface heating
            - .emph{Orographic}: air rising over mountains
            - .emph{Cyclonic}: air lifted in low-pressure systems
        - Also caused by contact with cooler surfaces or air masses

# Condensation Nuclei

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{50%} height:{100%}
        - Minute particles (1 $ \mu m $ ), initiating droplet formation.
        - surface for vapour to condense into liquid.
        - Include dust, smoke, sea salt
        - Without them, supersaturation can occur without precipitation
        - Forms a basis for **cloud seeding** (silver iodide, more recently *potassium chloride*)
        - Various forms of cloud seeding: References (Mather et al. 1997)
        - Case of a paper mill in South Africa.

            _Much controversy over the value of cloud seeding; Some studies support its effectiveness e.g. Gagin and Neumann, 1981; other authors query the results e.g. Rangno and Hobbs, 1995_



# Droplet Growth Processes


.align{center}
    .container width:{70%}
        .box
            Water/ice droplets need to be large enough for them weight to overcome upward draught (from a cloud).
            They need to grow from $ \approx $ 1 $ \mu m $ to  $ \approx $ 3000 $ \mu m $.

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{50%}
        - **Condensation**, difference in vapour pressure and water: slow, vapour adds to droplets
        - **Sublimation on ice**, difference in pressure is bigger: faster, due to greater vapour gradient
        - Main process that raindrops grow: **Collision and coalescence**, two water-drops collide and join together and they repeat.
            - Dominant in warm clouds.
            - Droplets collide, merge, and grow large enough to fall.

    .container width:{50%}
        .emph{Bergeon Process}

        - Explains how ices crystals are formed in mixed-phase clouds.
        - Important is the saturation vapour pressure.
        - $ P_{\text{sat. water over ice}} < P_{\text{ambient}} < P_{\text{sth}} $
        - The mechanism of droplet formation within clouds are not completely understood.



# Dewfall

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{50%}
        .emph{Condensation} of vapour onto cool surfaces:

        - Occurs at night when surfaces cool below dew point
        - Common in humid-temperate zones (e.g., autumn)
        - Forms on grass, leaves, metal, etc.
        - Minor in hydrological budget, but relevant to ecology and surface moisture processes

# Precipitation Distribution

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{40%}
        Precipitation varies across both **space** and **time**:
        - Spatial variation: different locations receive different amounts.
        - Temporal variation: amount of rainfall changes over time at the same location.

        Influences on precipitation fall into two categories:
        - **Static** influences: do not change from storm to storm (e.g. altitude, aspect, slope)
        - **Dynamic** influences: change with weather conditions (e.g. air masses, storm tracks)

        _Higher rainfall in the north-west states (Oregon and Washington) due to
        linked to wetter cyclonic weather systems from the
        northern Pacific. Higher rainfall in Florida and other
        southern states is linked to the warm waters of the
        Caribbean sea_

    .container width:{60%}
        !(100%)[USA 1996 Precipitation](./image/davie_fig_2-4.png)
        _National Atmospheric Deposition Program - annual precipitation USA in 1996.
        Although mountainous areas have a higher rainfall, and block rainfall reaching the centre,
        they do not provide the only explanation_


# Static Influences on Precipitation

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{50%}
        .mermaid
            flowchart LR
                A([Precipitation]) --> B([Dynamic Controls])
                A --> C([Static Controls])
                C --> D([Altitude])
                C --> E([Aspect])
                C --> F([Slope])

    .container width:{50%}

        Static influences are fixed features of the landscape:

        - **Altitude**: Modulating temperature. Higher elevations receive more rainfall due to cooling of rising air (orographic effect)
        - **Aspect**: Less important than altitude. Slopes facing prevailing winds often receive more precipitation.
            - Humid mid-latitudes (35-65 $ \degree $): cyclonic weather systems coming from W. So slopes facing east will be more sheltered.
        - **Slope**: Only important at very small scale - i.e., the difference between a level gauge and one on a slope.



# Case Study: The rain shadow effect

    .container width:{60%}
        - Predominant weather pattern for the South Island of New Zealand is a series of rain-bearing depressions sweeping up from the Southern Ocean, interrupted by drier blocking anticyclones.

        - Weather pattern: westerly airflow, bringing moist air from the Tasman Sea.
        - One the west side, mostly rain. On the eastern side: föhn (locally as nor-wester).

# Dynamic Influences on Precipitation

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%} height:{100%}
        Dynamic influences result from .emph{atmospheric processes} (climatic controls) that vary with time:
        - **Storm tracks**: paths of cyclones and weather systems
        - **Frontal systems**: interactions between warm and cold air masses
        - **Moisture availability**: seasonal shifts in humidity sources (e.g. monsoons)
        - **Convective activity**: varies by temperature and surface conditions
        - At the **global scale**, dynamic factors dominate:
            - Climate zones
            - Atmospheric circulation (e.g. ITCZ, subtropical highs)

        - At the **continental scale**, both static and dynamic factors matter:
            - Mountain ranges cause **rain shadow effects**
            - Seasonal wind and temperature patterns affect rainfall distribution

    .container width:{40%} height:{100%}
        !(100%)[Storm Tracks](image/internet_storm_tracks.webp)
        _Tropical oceans spawn approximately 80 tropical storms annually, and about two-thirds are severe (category 1 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale of intensity). Almost 90 percent of these storms form within $ 20 \degree $ north or south of the Equator_\

# Measurement of Precipitation

.row
    .container width:{60%}
        - Measured as a **vertical depth** of water (e.g. mm or inches).
        - Represents the depth that would accumulate if all water remained on the surface.
        - Used for **both rain and snow**:
            - Snow is often reported as **water equivalent**.
            - Recognizes that snow can occupy up to **90% more volume** than liquid water.

        - Due to **spatial variability**, there's a strong argument that catchment-scale precipitation **cannot be "measured."**
        - Thus, all precipitation "measurement" techniques are effectively **estimation** techniques.
        - For clarity in this course:
            - **Measurement**: quantifies actual water collected.
            - **Estimation**: uses surrogate variables (e.g., radar, satellite).

# Rainfall Measurement with Gauges

.row
    .container width:{30%}
        - **Rain gauge**: collects rainfall over a defined area, measures volume.
        - Volume is divided by the area to get **depth**.
        - Simple in concept — but prone to **multiple sources of error**.

# Errors in Rainfall Measurement

            A([Rainfall Measurement Errors]) --> B([Evaporation])
            A([Rainfall Measurement Errors]) --> C([Wetting])
            A([Rainfall Measurement Errors]) --> D([Rain Splash])
            A([Rainfall Measurement Errors]) --> E([Turbulence])

.row
    .container width:{50%}
        Four major sources of error:
        1. **Evaporation**: water lost before being measured.
        2. **Wetting**: water adheres to funnel walls.
    .container width:{50%}
        3. **Rain splash**: water splashes into or out of the gauge.
        4. **Turbulence**: wind distorts drop paths, reduces catch.


# Evaporation Loss

.row
    .container width:{60%}
        - Funnel-shaped design channels water to a **narrow opening**.
        - Reduces air mixing and exposure to sunlight.
        - Minimizes **evaporative losses** by:
            - Preventing warm air exchange
            - Shading the collected water
        - Evaporation is limited if turbulence is reduced (more in Chapter 3).
    .container width:{40%}
        !(100%)[Funnel shaped rain gauge](image/internet_tippingbucketrain.webp "All rain gauges use a funnel structure to avoid evaporative loss. A tipping bucket rain gauge.")




# Wetting Loss

.row
    .container width:{60%}
        - Water clings to **funnel walls** and may not reach the collector.
        - Losses are usually **small**, but significant during:
            - Light showers
            - Warm days
        - Solutions:
            - **Steep funnel sides**
            - **Non-stick surfaces** (e.g., copper or non-adhesive plastics)

# Rain Splash

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%} height:{100%}
        - Ideal gauge would sit flush with the ground — but this increases **splash-in**.
        - Funnel design prevents **splash-out**, creating a net **over-measurement**.
        - Surface-level gauges may flood or be covered by snow.
        - Raised gauges or **non-splash surrounds** are preferred.

        .container width:{50%}
        !(100%)[Metal Bucket](image/davie_fig_2-7.png "Illustration of non-splash grid around rain gauge, showing splash paths and protection effect.")

# Wind Turbulence and Gauge Height

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%} height:{100%}
        - Raised gauges reduce splash, but **disrupt airflow**.
        - Wind creates **turbulent eddies**, leading to **under-catch**.
        - Loss increases with:
            - Wind speed: At 20 km/h: up to **20% loss**, at 90 km/h: up to **40% loss**
            - Drop size
        - Solution: fit gauge with a **wind shield** (e.g. baffles or slats).
        - Shields reduce wind speed around the orifice.
        - Can **significantly improve** measurement accuracy.

# Rain measurement in Australia

.row
  .container width:{50%}
    .box title:{How to optimise?} background:{.lightred}
        - No universal "perfect" design.
        - The **best gauge** depends on:
            - Local conditions (e.g. snow, wind exposure)
            - Practical installation needs
        - The **non-splash grid + surface-level** gauge is closest to ideal:
            - Reduces splash and turbulence
            - Unsuitable for snow-prone areas (risk of burial)

  	- The standard rain gauge in Australia is a **203 mm manual gauge**, which collects rainfall into a graduated cylinder.
  	- It is mounted **0.3 m above the ground**, away from obstructions.
  	- Modern stations use **Tipping Bucket Rain Gauges (TBRG)**:
  	  - Each tip = 0.2 mm of rain
  	  - Measures rainfall intensity and rate

  .container width:{50%}
  	- **Snow gauges** are used in alpine areas with melt tanks or antifreeze methods.
  	- Readings are mostly taken at **9am daily**, often by volunteers.
  	- Rainfall is recorded to the nearest **0.2 mm** or **0.1 mm** in recent years.

# Challenges of Measuring Snowfall
.row
    .container width:{50%} padding:{0.5cm}
        .box background:{.lightblue}
            - Snow measurement faces **greater errors** than rainfall:
                - Snowflakes are **easily transported by wind** before and after settling.
                - Leads to **drifting** and **uneven surface distribution**.
            - Raindrops, by contrast, rarely redistribute after hitting the ground.
            - Measurement errors resemble **rain splash** but more extreme.
    .container width:{50%} padding:{0.5cm}
        .box background:{.lightblue}
            Two main approaches:

            1. **Snow gauges** (modified rain gauges)
            2. **Ground snow depth measurements**

            Both suffer from:
            - Wind transport and drift
            - Uneven accumulation
            - Sampling errors (point measurements ≠ area representation)



# Rain Gauge Modification for Snow
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%} padding:{1cm}
        Modifications needed to measure snow with a rain gauge:
        - **Heated rim** melts falling snow into water
            - Prevents snow buildup and overflow
            - Requires power supply — impractical in remote areas
        - **Drainage system** must move water away from heat source
            - Prevents **evaporation losses**
        - **Raised gauge** keeps instrument above snow surface
            - Increases **turbulence error**
            - Typically paired with **wind shields or deflectors**

        !(60%)[Snow Gauge](image/internet_snow_gauge.png "Snow-capable rain gauge: heated rim, elevated base, wind deflectors. Arrows showing airflow and melt pathway.")



# Measuring Snow Depth: Core Sampling
.row
    .container width:{50%}
        - **Core sampler**:
            - Extracts a vertical column, measures **depth** and **density**
            - Snow is then melted to determine **water equivalent depth**
        - Limitations:
            - Point-based, **non-continuous** measurementm; location-dependent: snow drift and exposure affect accuracy
            - Similar in limitation to daily manual rain measurements
    .container width:{50%}
        - **Snow pillows** measure **accumulated snow mass**
            - Capture snowpack **water storage**, not just depth
            - Used in hydrology for estimating **delayed runoff**

# From point measurements to spatial rainfall estimation

.row
  .container width:{60%}
  	- Rain gauges provide rainfall data at **specific points**.
  	- Hydrologists, however, need to know rainfall over a **whole catchment**.
  	- This requires converting **point data into areal estimates** using spatial averaging techniques.
  	- Factors influencing rainfall distribution:
  	  - Gauge density and placement
  	  - Topography (e.g. elevation, slope)
  	- In practice, we apply methods to estimate **catchment-wide rainfall** from gauge networks.
  	- These methods will be covered in the **tutorials**.

# Summary:
.box title:{Precipitation: Formation, Measurement, and Spatial Estimation} background:{.lightred}
    We covered therole of **precipitation** in the hydrological cycle, its **formation mechanisms**, and **factors affecting its distribution**.

    - **Conditions for precipitation**: atmospheric cooling, condensation nuclei, and droplet growth.
    - **Cooling mechanisms**: adiabatic processes, convective/orographic/cyclonic uplift.
    - **Growth processes**: condensation, coalescence, and the Bergeron process.
    - **Distribution influences**:
      - **Static**: altitude, aspect, slope.
      - **Dynamic**: storm tracks, frontal systems, moisture availability.
    - **Measurement techniques**:
      - Rain and snow gauges, tipping bucket systems.
      - Common **errors**: evaporation, wetting, splash, and wind turbulence.
    - **Snowfall challenges**: redistribution by wind, point measurement issues, gauge modifications.
    - **Spatial estimation**: need to translate point rainfall data into **catchment-scale estimates** using methods influenced by gauge placement and terrain.
