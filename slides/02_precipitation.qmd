# Understanding the Atmosphere

###!  Before we can understand precipitation, we need to understand the atmosphere, or more specifically:

# Composition of the Atmosphere

        .container borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
            ##! Let's understand pressure and temperature relationships first.

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{40%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
        - Atmosphere around us is a **mixture of gases**
        - Nitrogen and oxygen make up 99% of the atmosphere (plus some water vapour)
        - **Gravity** keeps the atmosphere close to the surface, hence the pressure is higher at the surface.
        - e.g., at 5500m elevation, the pressure is 50% of the surface pressure.
        - Units $ [Pa] = \frac{N}{m^{-2}} $, but commonly reported in $ [millibars] $ or $ [kPa] $
        - Water vapour accounts for $ < 0.3 \% $ of the atmospheric pressure.

# Cooling of the atmosphere

    .container width:{40%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
        - Moist Air = Water vapour + Dry air
        - The maximum amount of vapour that air can hold depends on the temperature.
        - ** Clausius-Clapeyron equation** describes the relationship between temperature and vapour pressure.

        $ \frac{dP}{dT} = \frac{P L}{T^2 \Delta v} $

        - _Figure 2_ ->\

        - **Vapour pressure** $ e(T) $, cannot exceed **saturated vapour pressure** $ e_{sat} $ .
        - $ e_{sat} $ represent absolute humidity, the point where vapour turns into liquid.
        - For this reason it is also known as the **dew point temperature** / **Frost point temperature**
        - We could also have **super-saturated** air, where the vapour pressure is higher than the saturated vapour pressure (maximum 1 or 2%).
        - The dotted line represents the saturation vapour pressure curve over ice.
        - Easier to escape from the liquid phase to the vapour phase compared to the solid phase.
        - Subzero temperatures: where desublimation occurse. (**hoarfrost**).

        - **Vapour Pressure** is a reflection of the concentration of water vapour molecules in air.
        - **Specific humidity**: mass of water vapour (g) per unit mass of air (kg).
        - Temperature increase of 10°C allows air to hold ~11g more water vapour per kg of air.
        - **Example**: At 30°C vs 20°C:
            - 30°C: 26 g water vapour per kg air
            - 20°C: 15 g water vapour per kg air
        - **Condensation example**: Cold glass in warm air forms droplets due to temperature drop.

    .container width:{50%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
        - **Ideal Gas Law** shows fundamental relationships between pressure, volume, and temperature.
        - The ratio between pressure and the product of temperature and density is constant:

        $ \frac{P}{T_a \cdot \rho_a} = R_a $

        where:
        - $ P $ = atmospheric pressure (kPa)
        - $ T_a $ = air temperature (K)
        - $ \rho_a $ = mass density of air (kg/m³)
        - $ R_a $ = gas constant for air

        If pressure decreases, the product of temperature and density must also decrease to maintain the constant.


# Adiabatic Cooling and Lapse Rates
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{30%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
        - **Adiabatic cooling**: When air moves upward to lower pressure, it expands and cools.
        - Cooling occurs due to **pressure and density changes**, not heat loss.
        - **Fundamentally important** in precipitation formation process.
        - **Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate (DALR)**: ~9.8°C per km for dry air.
        - **Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate (SALR)**: Slower than DALR due to latent heat release from condensation.
        - SALR can be **half the DALR** - precise value depends on pressure and temperature.

# Environmental Lapse Rate
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{30%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
        - **Environmental Lapse Rate (ELR)**: Conventional temperature decrease with altitude.
        - Related to distance from radiating body (Earth).
        - Approximately **6°C per km**, but varies.
        - **Three types of lapse rates**:
            - **DALR**: ~9.8°C/km (dry air)
            - **SALR**: ~4-6°C/km (saturated air, varies)
            - **ELR**: ~6°C/km (environmental, varies)

        ##! Now we understand the atmosphere, but how does precipitation form?

.whitespace height:{2cm}

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{40%}
        Three physical conditions must be met for precipitation to occur:

    .container width:{60%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
        - .ul{Cooling} of the atmosphere
        - .ul{Condensation} onto atmospheric nuclei
        - .ul{Growth} of water/ice droplets large enough to overcome updrafts
        - a .ul{supply} of moisture to continue the process

# How do we cool the air?

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{30%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
        - Cooling is essential for condensation and precipitation:
        - Rising air expands and cools (Boyle’s Law)
        - Main causes of uplift:
            - .ul{Convective}: surface heating
            - .ul{Orographic}: air rising over mountains
            - .ul{Cyclonic}: air lifted in low-pressure systems
        - Also caused by contact with cooler surfaces or air masses

# Condensation Nuclei

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{40%} height:{100%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
        - Minute particles (1 $ \mu m $ ), initiating droplet formation.
        - surface for vapour to condense into liquid.
        - Include dust, smoke, sea salt
        - Without them, supersaturation can occur without precipitation
        - Forms a basis for **cloud seeding** (silver iodide, more recently *potassium chloride*)
        - Various forms of cloud seeding: References (Mather et al. 1997)
        - Case of a paper mill in South Africa.

# Droplet Growth Processes


.row gap:{1cm} alignment:{center}
    .container width:{30%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
        - Water/ice droplets need to be large enough for them weight to overcome upward draught (from a cloud).
        - They need to grow from $ \approx $ 1 $ \mu m $ to  $ \approx $ 3000 $ \mu m $.

# Droplet Growth Processes

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{50%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
        - Difference in vapour pressure and water => vapour adds to droplets (**slow**)=> .ul{Condensation on water}.
        - Difference in pressure with ice bigger => **faster**, due to greater vapour gradient .ul{Sublimation on ice}.
        - Main process that raindrops grow: .ul{Collision and coalescence}, two water-drops collide and join together and they repeat.
            - Dominant in warm clouds.
            - Droplets collide, merge, and grow large enough to fall.
        - Larger droplet fall faster, sweep a larger area and are more likely to collide with other droplets.
        - When ice droplets grow by collision, it's called .ul{aggregation}.

# Bergeron Process
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
        - .ul{Bergeon-Findeisen Process} or cold cloud process.
        - At sub zero temperatures, the saturation vapour pressure over ice is lower than over water.
        - This means .ul{air is saturated for ice but not for water}.
        - Which means the ice particles can grow at the expense of the water droplets.
        - **Vapour diffusion**: vapour moves from higher pressure (cloud droplets) to lower pressure (ice particles).
        - But this results in drier clouds => cloud droplets evaporate.
        - $ e_{\text{sat. water over ice}} < P_{\text{ambient}} < e_{\text{sth}} $
        - Ice particles attract water vapour efficiently, causing **desublimation** (direct vapour to ice).

# Hail Formation
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{40%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
        - **Hail stones**: typically ~5mm, spherical, sometimes irregular ice particles.
        - **Size range**: golf ball size common, rare cases >15cm diameter recorded.
        - **Formation location**: highest parts of cumulonimbus clouds (storm clouds).
        - **Process**: ice particles circulate in violent up/down draughts.
        - **Growth mechanism**: ice particles collide with supercooled water droplets → immediate freezing.
        - **Cross-section**: alternating layers of clear and translucent ice.
            - **Clear ice**: slower freezing (cloud tops)
            - **Translucent ice**: instant freezing, trapped air

# Hail Formation Process
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{40%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
        - **Circulation**: hail stones circulate multiple times in violent draughts.
        - **Fall mechanism**: increasing mass eventually overcomes up draught.
        - **Melting**: if conditions warmer below cloud base → melt and fall as rain.
        - **Damage potential**: serious damage to infrastructure and agriculture.
        - **Economic impact**: US hail storms cause ~$1 billion/year in losses.

# Dewfall

.row gap:{1cm} alignment:{center}
    .container width:{40%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
        - .ul{Condensation} of vapour onto cool surfaces:
        - Occurs at night when surfaces cool below dew point
        - Common in humid-temperate zones (e.g., autumn)
        - Forms on grass, leaves, metal, etc.
        - Minor in hydrological budget, but relevant to ecology and surface moisture processes

# Precipitation Distribution

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{40%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
        Precipitation varies across both **space** and **time**:
        - Spatial variation: different locations receive different amounts.
        - Temporal variation: amount of rainfall changes over time at the same location.

        Influences on precipitation fall into two categories:
        - .ul{Static} influences: do not change from storm to storm (e.g. altitude, aspect, slope)
        - .ul{Dynamic} influences: change with weather conditions (e.g. air masses, storm tracks)

        _Higher rainfall in the north-west states (Oregon and Washington) due to
        linked to wetter cyclonic weather systems from the
        northern Pacific. Higher rainfall in Florida and other
        southern states is linked to the warm waters of the
        Caribbean sea_

        Static influences are fixed features of the landscape:

        - .ul{Altitude}: Modulating temperature. Higher elevations receive more rainfall due to cooling of rising air (orographic effect)
        - .ul{Aspect}: Less important than altitude. Slopes facing prevailing winds often receive more precipitation.
            - Humid mid-latitudes (35-65 $ \degree $): cyclonic weather systems coming from W. So slopes facing east will be more sheltered.
        - .ul{Slope}: Only important at very small scale - i.e., the difference between a level gauge and one on a slope.

# Dynamic Influences on Precipitation

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%} height:{100%}
        Dynamic influences result from .ul{atmospheric processes} (climatic controls) that vary with time:
        - **Storm tracks**: paths of cyclones and weather systems
        - **Frontal systems**: interactions between warm and cold air masses
        - **Moisture availability**: seasonal shifts in humidity sources (e.g. monsoons)
        - **Convective activity**: varies by temperature and surface conditions
        - At the **global scale**, dynamic factors dominate:
            - Climate zones
            - Atmospheric circulation (e.g. ITCZ, subtropical highs)

        - At the **continental scale**, both static and dynamic factors matter:
            - Mountain ranges cause **rain shadow effects**
            - Seasonal wind and temperature patterns affect rainfall distribution

# Measurement of Precipitation
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%}
        - Measured as a **vertical depth** of water (e.g. mm or inches).
        - Represents the depth that would accumulate if all water remained on the surface.
        - Used for **both rain and snow**:
            - Snow is often reported as **water equivalent**.
            - Recognizes that snow can occupy up to **90% more volume** than liquid water.

        - Due to **spatial variability**, there's a strong argument that catchment-scale precipitation **cannot be "measured."**
        - Thus, all precipitation "measurement" techniques are effectively **estimation** techniques.
        - For clarity in this course:
            - **Measurement**: quantifies actual water collected.
            - **Estimation**: uses surrogate variables (e.g., radar, satellite).

        Four major sources of error:
        1. **Evaporation**: water lost before being measured.
        2. **Wetting**: water adheres to funnel walls.
    .container width:{50%}
        3. **Rain splash**: water splashes into or out of the gauge.
        4. **Turbulence**: wind distorts drop paths, reduces catch.


# Evaporation Loss

.row
    .container width:{60%}
        - Funnel-shaped design channels water to a **narrow opening**.
        - Reduces air mixing and exposure to sunlight.
        - Minimizes **evaporative losses** by:
            - Preventing warm air exchange
            - Shading the collected water
        - Evaporation is limited if turbulence is reduced (more in Chapter 3).

# Wetting Loss

.row
    .container width:{60%}
        - Water clings to **funnel walls** and may not reach the collector.
        - Losses are usually **small**, but significant during:
            - Light showers
            - Warm days
        - Solutions:
            - **Steep funnel sides**
            - **Non-stick surfaces** (e.g., copper or non-adhesive plastics)

# Rain Splash

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%} height:{100%}
        - Ideal gauge would sit flush with the ground — but this increases **splash-in**.
        - Funnel design prevents **splash-out**, creating a net **over-measurement**.
        - Surface-level gauges may flood or be covered by snow.
        - Raised gauges or **non-splash surrounds** are preferred.

# Wind Turbulence and Gauge Height

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
        - Raised gauges reduce splash, but **disrupt airflow**.
        - Wind creates **turbulent eddies**, leading to **under-catch**.
        - Loss increases with:
            - Wind speed: At 20 km/h: up to **20% loss**, at 90 km/h: up to **40% loss**
            - Drop size
    .container width:{40%} borderwidth:{1pt} padding:{0.5cm} radius:{0.5cm} background:{.lightblue}
        - Solution: fit gauge with a **wind shield** (e.g. baffles or slats).
        - Shields reduce wind speed around the orifice.
        - Can **significantly improve** measurement accuracy.

    - No universal "perfect" design.
    - The **best gauge** depends on:
        - Local conditions (e.g. snow, wind exposure)
        - Practical installation needs
    - The **non-splash grid + surface-level** gauge is closest to ideal:
        - Reduces splash and turbulence
        - Unsuitable for snow-prone areas (risk of burial)

  	- The standard rain gauge in Australia is a **203 mm manual gauge**, which collects rainfall into a graduated cylinder.
  	- It is mounted **0.3 m above the ground**, away from obstructions.
  	- Modern stations use **Tipping Bucket Rain Gauges (TBRG)**:
  	  - Each tip = 0.2 mm of rain
  	  - Measures rainfall intensity and rate

  .container width:{50%}
  	- **Snow gauges** are used in alpine areas with melt tanks or antifreeze methods.
  	- Readings are mostly taken at **9am daily**, often by volunteers.
  	- Rainfall is recorded to the nearest **0.2 mm** or **0.1 mm** in recent years.

# Challenges of Measuring Snowfall
.row
    .container width:{50%} padding:{0.5cm}
        .box background:{.lightblue}
            - Snow measurement faces **greater errors** than rainfall:
                - Snowflakes are **easily transported by wind** before and after settling.
                - Leads to **drifting** and **uneven surface distribution**.
            - Raindrops, by contrast, rarely redistribute after hitting the ground.
            - Measurement errors resemble **rain splash** but more extreme.
    .container width:{50%} padding:{0.5cm}
        .box background:{.lightblue}
            Two main approaches:

            1. **Snow gauges** (modified rain gauges)
            2. **Ground snow depth measurements**

            Both suffer from:
            - Wind transport and drift
            - Uneven accumulation
            - Sampling errors (point measurements ≠ area representation)



# Rain Gauge Modification for Snow
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%} padding:{1cm}
        Modifications needed to measure snow with a rain gauge:
        - **Heated rim** melts falling snow into water
            - Prevents snow buildup and overflow
            - Requires power supply — impractical in remote areas
        - **Drainage system** must move water away from heat source
            - Prevents **evaporation losses**
        - **Raised gauge** keeps instrument above snow surface
            - Increases **turbulence error**
            - Typically paired with **wind shields or deflectors**

# Measuring Snow Depth: Core Sampling
.row
    .container width:{50%}
        - **Core sampler**:
            - Extracts a vertical column, measures **depth** and **density**
            - Snow is then melted to determine **water equivalent depth**
        - Limitations:
            - Point-based, **non-continuous** measurementm; location-dependent: snow drift and exposure affect accuracy
            - Similar in limitation to daily manual rain measurements
    .container width:{50%}
        - **Snow pillows** measure **accumulated snow mass**

# From point measurements to spatial rainfall estimation

.row

  	- Rain gauges provide rainfall data at **specific points**.
  	- Hydrologists, however, need to know rainfall over a **whole catchment**.
  	- This requires converting **point data into areal estimates** using spatial averaging techniques.
  	- Factors influencing rainfall distribution:
  	  - Gauge density and placement
  	  - Topography (e.g. elevation, slope)
  	- In practice, we apply methods to estimate **catchment-wide rainfall** from gauge networks.
  	- These methods will be covered in the **tutorials**.

# Summary:
.box title:{Precipitation: Formation, Measurement, and Spatial Estimation} background:{.lightred}
    We covered therole of **precipitation** in the hydrological cycle, its **formation mechanisms**, and **factors affecting its distribution**.

    - **Conditions for precipitation**: atmospheric cooling, condensation nuclei, and droplet growth.
    - **Cooling mechanisms**: adiabatic processes, convective/orographic/cyclonic uplift.
    - **Growth processes**: condensation, coalescence, and the Bergeron process.
    - **Distribution influences**:
      - **Static**: altitude, aspect, slope.
      - **Dynamic**: storm tracks, frontal systems, moisture availability.
    - **Measurement techniques**:
      - Rain and snow gauges, tipping bucket systems.
      - Common **errors**: evaporation, wetting, splash, and wind turbulence.
    - **Snowfall challenges**: redistribution by wind, point measurement issues, gauge modifications.
    - **Spatial estimation**: need to translate point rainfall data into **catchment-scale estimates** using methods influenced by gauge placement and terrain.
