    .container width:{60%}
        .box title:{Definitions} background:{.lightblue}
            - Any process that results in water moving toward channelized flow, following **precipitation reaching the surface**.

        - Mechanisms responsible for delivering water to streams and rivers.
        - **River/streamflow**: The movement of water in channels toward the ocean.
        - Riverflow is typically quantified as **discharge**: _volume of water per unit time_ $ \frac{m^3}{s} $.

        - **Peak/storm flow**: Water present in a stream during and immediately after a significant rainfall event.
        - Globally controlled by rainfall intensity and duration; at catchment scale, affected by
        catchment **size**, **slope**, **shape**, soil characteristics, vegetation type and cover,
        degree of urbanisation, and **antecedent soil moisture**.
        - Periods between peaks are referred to as **baseflow** (distinct from low flow), typically understood to be supplied by groundwater.

        - Rising limb: Steep section leading up to peak flow.
        - Contributed by: **Channel precipitation** (rain falling directly into the stream) and rapid runoff.
        - Recession limb: Follows the peak and shows a gradual decline in streamflow.
        - Influenced by stormwater arriving from upstream and contributions from subsurface flow.

        Continuous sheets of overland water flow are rarely observed in nature.

    .container width:{50%}
        - **Overland flow**: Water flowing over the land surface after precipitation.
        - Horton (1933) .cite {horton1933role}: Overland flow occurs when rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity of the soil.\
            Excess water then flows as a shallow surface layer.\
            Infiltration capacity acts as a **threshold**.
        - .emph{However}, in most cases, infiltration rates exceed typical rainfall intensities.

        - Betson (1964) .cite {betson1964watershed}: Introduced the concept of partial contributing areas — only specific parts of a catchment produce overland flow.\
            The importance of infiltration is retained, but the idea of uniform thin flow is questioned.
        - Hewlett & Hibbert (1967) .cite {mcdonnel2009hewlett}: Overland flow occurs when the water table rises to the surface due to infiltration and throughflow.\
            This results in saturated areas near channels and lower slopes where **return flow** and **direct precipitation** dominate.

# Who was right?

.box title:{Ideas on stormflow} background:{.lightblue}
    - All theories capture aspects of the truth.
    - Saturated overland flow dominates in humid, mid-latitude regions.
    - The **variable source area** concept best represents stormflow processes.
    - In arid/semi-arid zones, intense rainfall and low infiltration lead to **flash flooding**.
    - Hydrophobic soils may exhibit **nonlinear infiltration**: initially very low, then increasing.

    _Comparison of key theories explaining stormflow generation_

# Subsurface flow
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{50%}
        - The variable source area model proposes that only parts of the catchment contribute to the hydrograph.
        - Overland flow alone can't explain total discharge observed in hydrographs.
        - The gradual decline in the hydrograph’s recession limb suggests a **subsurface flow** component.
        - Tracer studies show significant presence of _older water_ during stormflow.
        - This points to **throughflow** and **groundwater contributions**.
    .container width:{50%}
        !(100%)[Throughflow](image/internet_throughflow.jpeg)

.align{center}
    .container width:{81%}
        .box title:{Throughflow}
            - **Throughflow**: Movement of water through the unsaturated zone (soil matrix).
            - Described by the Darcy or Richards equations.
            - Flow is not only vertical; on slopes, water moves laterally downslope.
            - Example: **Fine sandy loam** → ~13 mm/hour flow rate.

# Piston Flow
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%}
        - Proposed by Horton & Hawkins (195): Water entering at the top of the soil column displaces older water at the bottom, which then enters the stream.
        - Similar to a piston where top pressure pushes fluid at the bottom.
        - The discharge can be viewed as a pressure wave.
        - Though unconventional, the combination of rainfall above and impermeable bedrock below creates this **piston effect**.
        - The added water generates a hydraulic gradient that drives water movement along the base of the soil layer, which typically has higher conductivity.
        - Analogy: A thatched roof—water moves quickly along aligned channels (macropores), especially in the downslope direction.

# Macropores

    .container width:{60%}
        .box title:{Macropores}
            Large, interconnected pores in soil, generally >3 mm in diameter.

        - **Key pathway** for rapid subsurface flow.
        - **Hydrological role**: Enable fast water movement bypassing much of the soil matrix.
        - Ongoing debate: Whether these pores form continuous flow networks or are limited by disconnected segments.

# Groundwater contribution
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%}
        - Historically, groundwater was thought to only contribute to baseflow.
        - Farvolden (1979) introduced the **capillary fringe hypothesis**.
        - Concept: A “groundwater ridge” forms near the stream during recharge.
        - Added infiltration saturates the unsaturated zone, generating hydraulic gradients that drive discharge to the stream.
        - The water-saturation relationship in soils is **nonlinear**.
        - This mechanism increases both the rate and volume of discharge.
        - The Maimai experiments confirmed groundwater as a **rapid** source of streamflow.

# Measuring streamflow
## Velocity-area method
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{50%}
        - The velocity–area method multiplies stream velocity by cross-sectional area to estimate discharge.
        - Black dots: locations of velocity readings.
        - Dashed lines: triangular/trapezoidal cross sections.

        _The velocity–area method of streamflow measurement. The black circles indicate the position of current meter velocity readings. Dashed lines represent the triangular or trapezoidal cross-sectional area through which the velocity is measured_.



# Velocity–area method: considerations

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%}
        - The **velocity–area method** requires the assumption that the velocity measured is representative of the entire cross-sectional flow.
        - Since multiple measurements across the depth are rarely feasible, adjustments are needed to account for velocity variations.
        - Water flows faster near the surface than near the bed due to **bed friction**.
        - A general guideline: measure velocity at **60% of depth** from the surface (or 40% above the bed).
        - For deeper rivers, average readings at **20% and 80% of depth** for better accuracy.

        - If no velocity meter is available, a **float method** can provide rough estimates by timing surface travel over a measured distance.
        - Surface floats **overestimate** true velocity since they ride faster-flowing surface water.


    .container width:{40%}
        !(100%)[Modern ways](image/internet_flowgauging.jpg)
        - The velocity–area method works well for **small rivers**, but its **accuracy depends on sampling strategy**.
        - It becomes less reliable in **turbid, shallow, or rough-bedded streams** (e.g., mountain creeks).
        - In such cases, consider alternative methods like **dilution gauging**.
        _.cite {davie2019fundamentals} Illustration of float-based surface velocity measurement_


# Stage–Discharge Relationship

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%}
        - **Stage** = water level or height at a specific point in a river.
        - **Discharge** = volumetric flow rate (e.g. $ \frac{m^3}{s} $).
        - Repeated discharge measurements (via velocity–area method) enable creation of a **rating curve**.
        - A rating curve relates stage to discharge and allows **continuous discharge estimation** from simple stage measurements.
        - Developed by pairing stage readings (e.g. using a **stilling well**) with discharge data.
        - Rating curves are typically **non-linear**, reflecting the geometry of riverbanks:\
            As rivers fill between banks, **more water is required to raise stage** than at low flows.

        - Assumes a **stable riverbed**. Changes (e.g. due to flood scouring or deposition) will invalidate the curve.
        - This is why **flumes or weirs** are often installed to stabilize the control section.


    .container width:{40%}
        Limitations:
        - Few high-flow measurements → less reliable for peak floods.
        - High-flow events are dangerous and infrequent.
        - Thus, **errors increase at the upper end** of the curve.

        Remember: discharge is **inferred** from measured stage — not directly observed.

        .cite {davie2019fundamentals} _Fig 5.8 - A stage-discharge (rating) curve_


# Flumes and weirs

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%}
        - **Flumes and weirs** are stream gauging structures that extend the **stage–discharge** method by imposing control over stream velocity and cross-sectional area.
        - By doing so, they provide a **continuous record** of stream discharge.
        - The key is to **standardize flow** through a known cross-sectional area so that velocity becomes predictable or known.
        - This is especially useful because stream velocity varies with depth, but gauging structures enforce a **consistent flow regime**.
        - These structures are designed so that discharge becomes a function of **stage** alone.

    .container width:{40%}
        !(100%)[Gauging structure](image/internet_v-notch-weir.jpg)


# Discharge equations for weirs

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{50%}
        - **Discharge** through weirs is determined by known formulas based on weir shape.
        - For a **V-notch weir** (Very accurate for low-flow rates):\
          $ Q = 0.53 \sqrt{2g} \, C \, \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) b^{2.5} $
        - Where:
            - $ Q $ = discharge ($ \text{m}^3/\text{s} $)
            - $ g $ = gravity (9.81 $ \text{m}/\text{s}^2 $)
            - $ C $ = discharge coefficient (depends on $ \theta $)
            - $ \theta $ = notch angle
            - $ b $ = stage height (m)
        - For a 90° V-notch, $ C = 0.578 $, and:
          $ Q = 1.366\ b^{2.5} $
        - These equations follow **ISO 1438** standards for gauging structures.

# Flumes and weirs: design considerations

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%}
        - The **shape** of the gauging structure affects sensitivity to changes in flow:
            - V-notches are excellent for **low flows** due to higher sensitivity.
            - As discharge increases, cross-sectional area expands nonlinearly.
        - Under **high flows**, it's crucial that water doesn't bypass the structure.
        - V-notches are commonly used with **90° or 120° angles** based on application needs.
        - **Stilling ponds** slow down water before measurement but can trap sediment.

        _A trapezoidal flume helps flush sediment_

# Flumes vs. weirs

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{50%}
        - **Flumes and weirs** both allow continuous measurement of stream discharge but have **key differences**:
            - **Weir**: Water flows **over** a structure (like a small waterfall).
            - **Flume**: Water flows **through** a structure without dropping.
        - Flumes tend to produce **less sedimentation**, making them suitable for **high-energy environments**.

        .cite {davie2019fundamentals} V notch weir.

    .container width:{30%}
        - Trapezoidal flumes can **flush out sediment** efficiently, avoiding stilling pond buildup.
        - Both are suitable for small streams but not large rivers, due to structural stress.
