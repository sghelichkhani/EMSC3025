# Water Course

Welcome to the water course project 

## About the Project

This is an effort to bring together material related to water modelling and studies that are related to the course EMSC3025/6025 delievered at the Earth Science School of Earth Sciecnes at the ANU. The contents are focused:

- Delivering an in depth understanding of the water cycle. 
- A primary understanding of precipitation, evaporation, run off and groundwater
- Advance understsanding of groundwater processes.
- Excerices

For the content of teh course please go to [Content Page](content.md)

## Get Involved

Whether you're a hydrologist, modeller or student, or whether you are in industry or public service through, please get invovled if you think this material can be improved. 

- Participating in training and courses
- Providing feedback

# About the Course

## 🌍 Welcome to our *Water Course*

This website hosts the lecture materials for the *EMSC3025/6025 Water Course*, taught at the _Australian National University_ (ANU) under course codes **EMSC3025 / EMSC6025**. The course explores the science of water in the environment, with a focus on subsurface processes and groundwater systems.

This course aims to provide a comprehensive foundation in the understanding, measurement, and modeling of water across the entire hydrologic cycle—from atmospheric inputs to deep aquifer systems—with particular emphasis on **subsurface water hydrology**.

---

## 🧭 Course Structure

The course is organised in a series of lecture-based modules that follow the natural flow of the water cycle. Each lecture is delivered with structured slide sets, available here.

---

## 📚 Reference Materials

This course draws exclusively from two comprehensive and authoritative texts:

- **Tim Davie** (2008), *Fundamentals of Hydrology*, 2nd Edition, Routledge.
  _Used for precipitation, evaporation, runoff, and surface hydrology._

- **Franklin W. Schwartz & Hubao Zhang** (2024), *Fundamentals of Groundwater*, 2nd Edition, Wiley.
  _Used for soil moisture, aquifers, flow theory, and groundwater management._

Please refer to these books throughout the course for deeper insight and examples.
