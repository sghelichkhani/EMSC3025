# Ωmega: Optimised Modelling for Groundwater in Australia

Welcome to the Ωmega project — an effort focused on advancing groundwater modelling through optimisation techniques, high-performance computing, and open, reproducible workflows.

## About the Project

Ωmega brings together researchers, developers, and stakeholders to enhance the scientific and operational capabilities of groundwater modelling in Australia. Our aim is to:

- Develop robust inverse methods for groundwater flow and transport
- Leverage optimisation for calibration, data assimilation, and scenario testing
- Promote transparency, reproducibility, and interoperability across tools and data
- Enable integration with surface water, climate, and infrastructure models

## Get Involved

Whether you're a hydrologist, modeller or student, or whether you are in industry or public service through:

- Collaborating on applied case studies
- Contributing to the code and methods
- Participating in training and courses
