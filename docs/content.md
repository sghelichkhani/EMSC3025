### - **NGV Triennial | JR's Homily to Country**
This powerful visual work by artist JR documents a procession through the dry Menindee Lakes in New South Wales, drawing attention to the ecological decline of the Darling / Baaka River ‚Äî a major tributary in Australia‚Äôs largest river system.

More than a scientific issue, the river is part of the living cultural heritage of the Baakandji people. The project is a reminder that hydrology is not just about water as a resource, but about relationships with land, history, and community ‚Äî particularly in a country like Australia, where Indigenous knowledge offers vital insights into managing water more justly and sustainably.
