# About the Course

## üåç Welcome to our *Water Course*

This website hosts the lecture materials for the *EMSC3025/6025 Water Course*, taught at the _Australian National University_ (ANU) under course codes **EMSC3025 / EMSC6025**. The course explores the science of water in the environment, with a focus on subsurface processes and groundwater systems.

This course aims to provide a comprehensive foundation in the understanding, measurement, and modeling of water across the entire hydrologic cycle‚Äîfrom atmospheric inputs to deep aquifer systems‚Äîwith particular emphasis on **subsurface water hydrology**.

## üß≠ Course Structure

The course is organised in a series of lecture-based modules that follow the natural flow of the water cycle. Each lecture is delivered with structured slide sets, available here.

## üìö Reference Materials

This course draws exclusively from two comprehensive and authoritative texts:

- **Tim Davie** (2008), *Fundamentals of Hydrology*, 2nd Edition, Routledge.
  _Used for precipitation, evaporation, runoff, and surface hydrology._

- **Franklin W. Schwartz & Hubao Zhang** (2024), *Fundamentals of Groundwater*, 2nd Edition, Wiley.
  _Used for soil moisture, aquifers, flow theory, and groundwater management._

Please refer to these books throughout the course for deeper insight and examples.
