# Evaporation

            Transfer of liquid water into gasious state into the atmosphere

        Evaportation's importance is mainly affected by two factors:
        - The amount of available energy
        - Available water

        Both of these are modulated by .emph{climate}.
        Think of cases where evaporation might not be as important:
        - Humid climate in winter: much water but **limited energy**
        - Arid climate in dry season: much energy but **limited water**

        _Available water and energy control  the main controling factors_

# Different Definitions of Evaportaion
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{50%}
        .box title:{Evaportaion} background:{.lightblue}
            - **Open water Evaporation**, $ E_O $: Evaportation above a
            body of water such as lakes, streams, oceans. As can be see in
            global water cycle figure, largest source of evaporation.
            - **Potential Evaporation**, $ E_{pt} $ : Amount of evaportation above land if there was unlimited water.
            - **Total Evaportation**, $ B_t $:  This is the actual evaportation. Wet seasons: $ E_t \approx E_{pt} $

        .align{center}
            We are mostly interested in $ E_O $ and $ E_t $, but $ E_{pt} $ gives us a good indicator of what $ E_t $ might be.

        Transpiration is the result of photosynthesis and respiration in the plants.
        - It is controled by the ability of the leafs in openning or closing of the leafs stomata in response to vapour pressure difference.
        - It is further control by amount of water, the soild, the ability of plants to tranfer water to the leaves.

        .box type:{warning} background:{.lightblue}
            We are considering evaporation as a negative source. But water lost, is just transferred to the atmosphere. A meteorologist would consider evaporation as
            a positive source and dewafll as a negative one.

# Evaporation as a process

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{70%}
        _Dalton_ (1766-1844): The English physicist was the first to recognise the relationship between wind, air dryness, and evaporation

        **Formula:** $ E = C (e_x - e_a) $

        **Where:**
        - $ E $ — Evaporation rate.
        - $ e_x $ — Vapor pressure at the water surface.
        - $ eₐ $ — Vapor pressure of the surrounding air.
        - $ C $ — Empirical constant (depends on wind, temperature, etc.).

        **Key Idea**: Evaporation increases with the difference in vapor pressure between the water surface and the air.

# Available Energy

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{50%}
        Main source of energy is from the sun. Sun's radiation is filtered by the clouds, water vapour and absorbed by trees and tall buildings.

        $ Q^{\ast} = Q_S \pm Q_L \pm Q_G $

        - $ Q^{\ast} $: net radiation
        - $ Q_S $: Sun's direct radiation (Short wave), heat we feel as warmth
        - $ Q_L $: Latent heat due to change in phase. $ Q_L < 0 $ when Water --> Gas, $ Q_L > 0 $ when Gas --> Water.
        - $ Q_G $: Energy absorbed and released from the soil.

        Two other sources of energy that _might_ become important:
        - In urban settings, energy released from buildings  in cold winters. From organic sources of energy.
        - Advective heat: As introduced in [introduction](./00_introduction/text.html)
