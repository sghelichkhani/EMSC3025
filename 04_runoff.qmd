# Runoff

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%}
        .box title:{Definitions} background:{.lightblue}
            - Any process leading to movemement of water to channelised flow, after **reaching the surface as precipitation**.

        - The mechanisms that lead to water entering the stream.
        - **River/streamflow**: Moving of channelised flow towards ocean.
        - Riverflow is often expressed as **discharge**: _volume of water over time_ $ \frac{m^3}{s} $.

        - **Peak/storm flow**: Water in the stream during and immediately after a significant rainfall event.
        - Globally determined by rainfall intensity and duration+upstream charactristics; On catchment scale determined by
        catchment **size**, but other factors include **slope angles**, **shape** of catchment, soil type, vegetation type and percentage cover,
         degree of urbanisation and the **antecedent soil moisture**.
        - Steady periods between peaks is **baseflow** (Different from lowflow). With a consensus that this is coming from groundwater.

# Storm hydrograph in detail

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%}
        - Rising limb: Steep part leading to the highest flow.
        - Coming from: **Channel precipitation**: Rain coming directly to channel, and rapid runoff mechanism
        - Recession limb: After the limb and characterised by long, slow decrease in streamflow.
        - Influenced by storm water arriving at the mouth of a catchment, and through/groundwater flow.

        .whitespace height:{1cm}
        Exactly how much water moves to channelised flow from precipitation is one that cannot be easily answered.

        - **Overland flow**: Flow of water at surface after precipitation reaches the ground.
        - Horton 1933 .cite {horton1933role}: overland flow occurred when the rainfall rate was higher than the infiltration rate of a soil.\
            Excess water travels as a thin sheet of water.\
            Infiltration capacity works as a **barrier**.
        - .emph{But} infiltration rates are higher than most rainfall rates.

        - Betson 1964 .cite {betson1964watershed}: Partial areas concept, within a catchment only certain areas contribute to overland flow.\
            The role of infiltraion remains intact, but thin wate layer idea is being challenged.
        - Hewlett Hibbert 1967 .cite {mcdonnel2009hewlett}: Through a mixture of infiltration and throughfall the watertable would rise until in some places it reached the surface.\
            Overland flow is a mixture of return flow and rainfall fallin on saturated areas.
            Adjacent to stream channels and base of slopes: table is closest to the surface and likelies to overflow.

# Who was right?

.box title:{Ideas on stormflow} background:{.lightblue}
    - All were partially right!
    - Saturated overland flow is dominant in humid, mid-latitude areas.
    - Variable source areas concept is the most valid description of stormflow processes.
    - In arid and semi-arid zones, extremely high rainfall rates + low infiltration rates (fed by convective storms, leading to **flash flooding**)
    - Instances of **hydrophobic soils** -> Nonlinear infiltration rates, extremely low first and then normal

    _Summary of the ideas on how stormflow is generated in a catchment_

# Subsurface flow
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{50%}
        - Variable source areas concept: only certain areas contribute to the hydrograph.
        - Hard to reconcile total water shown in a hydrograph if only overland flow contributes.
        - The slow attenuation of the recession limb of the hydrograph => **subsurface flow**
        - Tracer studies suggests large amount of _old water_ present in storm hydrograph.
        - **Througflow** and **groundwater** can only explain this.

        !(100%)[Throughflow](image/internet_throughflow.jpeg)

.align{center}
    .container width:{81%}
        .box title:{Throughflow}
            - **Throughflow**: Movement of water through the unsaturated zone (soil matrix).
            - The movement is describe through the Darcy/Richards equations
            - The movement of water is not only vertical. With a sloping water table on a hillsope water moves down a slope.
            - **Fine sandy loam** => 13 mm/hour.

# Piston Flow
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%}
        - Proposed by Horton & Hawkins (195): Water entering at the top, displaces water at the bottom of the soil column => water enters the stream.
        - The same way that pressure from top the piston chamber leads to release of pressure a the bottom.
        - Release to the stream can be looked at as a wave.
        - While it may feel far-fetched, the addition of rainwater from top, and bed rock from bottom resembles the setting of a piston.
        - Therefore, the hydraulic gradient created by an addition of water to the bottom of the soik column, already close to satureated, that forces water along the base, with higher conductivity.
        - Analogy of thatched roof: straws are very efficient in transporting water to the gutter. Soil in the downslop direction => higher conductivity.

# Macropores

        !(100%)[Macropores](image/internet_macropores.jpg)
    .container width:{60%}
        .box title:{Macropores}
            Large pores within a soil matrix, typically with a diameter greater than 3 mm.

        - **Proposed mechanism** for enhanced throughflow rates in soils.
        - **Hydrological significance**: Provide rapid conduits for subsurface water movement.
        - **Key debate**: Whether macropores form continuous pathways for water flow, or if flow is ultimately limited by the discontinuous nature of macropore networks.


# Groundwater contribution
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%}
        - Traditionally, hydrology considered groundwater as contributing only to baseflow.
        - Farvolden (1979) introduced the **capillary fringe hypothesis**.
        - A "groundwater ridge" is a rise in the water table adjacent to a stream.
        - When infiltration adds water to the unsaturated zone, it can become saturated, creating a positive hydraulic head that expels water toward the stream.
        - Note the non-linear relationship between soil water content and saturation.
        - This process not only enables water discharge, but can also increase the total amount of discharge.
        - The Maimai experiment confirmed that groundwater can be a primary contributor to rapid streamflow.

        !(100%)[Maimai River](image/davie_fig_5-5.png)
        _.cite {davie2019fundamentals} Many of the features described here were observed in the study by McGlynn et al. (2002) on the Maimai hillslopes. While tracer experiments confirmed the existence of macropores, the observed high flow velocities can only be explained by significant groundwater contributions; i.e., Piston Flow_.

# Measuring streamflow
## Velocity-area metho.
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{40%}
        - The velocity–area method measures the stream velocity, the stream cross-sectional area and multi- plies the two together.
        - Black circles indicate the position of velocity readings.
        - Dashed shows triangular or trapezoidal cross-sectional area.
