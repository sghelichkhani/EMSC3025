# Runoff

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%}
        .box title:{Definitions} background:{.lightblue}
            - Any process that results in water moving toward channelized flow, following **precipitation reaching the surface**.

        - Mechanisms responsible for delivering water to streams and rivers.
        - **River/streamflow**: The movement of water in channels toward the ocean.
        - Riverflow is typically quantified as **discharge**: _volume of water per unit time_ $ \frac{m^3}{s} $.

        - **Peak/storm flow**: Water present in a stream during and immediately after a significant rainfall event.
        - Globally controlled by rainfall intensity and duration; at catchment scale, affected by
        catchment **size**, **slope**, **shape**, soil characteristics, vegetation type and cover,
        degree of urbanisation, and **antecedent soil moisture**.
        - Periods between peaks are referred to as **baseflow** (distinct from low flow), typically understood to be supplied by groundwater.

# Storm hydrograph in detail

.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%}
        - Rising limb: Steep section leading up to peak flow.
        - Contributed by: **Channel precipitation** (rain falling directly into the stream) and rapid runoff.
        - Recession limb: Follows the peak and shows a gradual decline in streamflow.
        - Influenced by stormwater arriving from upstream and contributions from subsurface flow.

        The exact proportion of precipitation that becomes channelized flow is difficult to determine.

        Continuous sheets of overland water flow are rarely observed in nature.

    .container width:{50%}
        - **Overland flow**: Water flowing over the land surface after precipitation.
        - Horton (1933) .cite {horton1933role}: Overland flow occurs when rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity of the soil.\
            Excess water then flows as a shallow surface layer.\
            Infiltration capacity acts as a **threshold**.
        - .emph{However}, in most cases, infiltration rates exceed typical rainfall intensities.

        - Betson (1964) .cite {betson1964watershed}: Introduced the concept of partial contributing areas — only specific parts of a catchment produce overland flow.\
            The importance of infiltration is retained, but the idea of uniform thin flow is questioned.
        - Hewlett & Hibbert (1967) .cite {mcdonnel2009hewlett}: Overland flow occurs when the water table rises to the surface due to infiltration and throughflow.\
            This results in saturated areas near channels and lower slopes where **return flow** and **direct precipitation** dominate.

# Who was right?

.box title:{Ideas on stormflow} background:{.lightblue}
    - All theories capture aspects of the truth.
    - Saturated overland flow dominates in humid, mid-latitude regions.
    - The **variable source area** concept best represents stormflow processes.
    - In arid/semi-arid zones, intense rainfall and low infiltration lead to **flash flooding**.
    - Hydrophobic soils may exhibit **nonlinear infiltration**: initially very low, then increasing.

    _Comparison of key theories explaining stormflow generation_

# Subsurface flow
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{50%}
        - The variable source area model proposes that only parts of the catchment contribute to the hydrograph.
        - Overland flow alone can't explain total discharge observed in hydrographs.
        - The gradual decline in the hydrograph’s recession limb suggests a **subsurface flow** component.
        - Tracer studies show significant presence of _older water_ during stormflow.
        - This points to **throughflow** and **groundwater contributions**.

        !(100%)[Throughflow](image/internet_throughflow.jpeg)

.align{center}
    .container width:{81%}
        .box title:{Throughflow}
            - **Throughflow**: Movement of water through the unsaturated zone (soil matrix).
            - Described by the Darcy or Richards equations.
            - Flow is not only vertical; on slopes, water moves laterally downslope.
            - Example: **Fine sandy loam** → ~13 mm/hour flow rate.

# Piston Flow
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%}
        - Proposed by Horton & Hawkins (195): Water entering at the top of the soil column displaces older water at the bottom, which then enters the stream.
        - Similar to a piston where top pressure pushes fluid at the bottom.
        - The discharge can be viewed as a pressure wave.
        - Though unconventional, the combination of rainfall above and impermeable bedrock below creates this **piston effect**.
        - The added water generates a hydraulic gradient that drives water movement along the base of the soil layer, which typically has higher conductivity.
        - Analogy: A thatched roof—water moves quickly along aligned channels (macropores), especially in the downslope direction.

# Macropores
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{40%}
        !(100%)[Macropores](image/internet_macropores.jpg)
    .container width:{60%}
        .box title:{Macropores}
            Large, interconnected pores in soil, generally >3 mm in diameter.

        - **Key pathway** for rapid subsurface flow.
        - **Hydrological role**: Enable fast water movement bypassing much of the soil matrix.
        - Ongoing debate: Whether these pores form continuous flow networks or are limited by disconnected segments.

# Groundwater contribution
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{60%}
        - Historically, groundwater was thought to only contribute to baseflow.
        - Farvolden (1979) introduced the **capillary fringe hypothesis**.
        - Concept: A “groundwater ridge” forms near the stream during recharge.
        - Added infiltration saturates the unsaturated zone, generating hydraulic gradients that drive discharge to the stream.
        - The water-saturation relationship in soils is **nonlinear**.
        - This mechanism increases both the rate and volume of discharge.
        - The Maimai experiments confirmed groundwater as a **rapid** source of streamflow.

        _.cite {davie2019fundamentals} McGlynn et al. (2002) confirmed significant groundwater contributions to streamflow at Maimai, including piston flow and macropore evidence._

# Measuring streamflow
## Velocity-area metho.
.row gap:{1cm}
    .container width:{40%}
        - The velocity–area method multiplies stream velocity by cross-sectional area to estimate discharge.
        - Black dots: locations of velocity readings.
        - Dashed lines: triangular/trapezoidal cross sections.
