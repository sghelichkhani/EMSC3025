# Runoff

            - Any process leading to movemement of water to channelised flow, after **reaching the surface as precipitation**.

        - The mechanisms that lead to water entering the stream.
        - **River/streamflow**: Moving of channelised flow towards ocean.
        - Riverflow is often expressed as **discharge**: _volume of water over time_ $ \frac{m^3}{s} $.

        - **Peak/storm flow**: Water in the stream during and immediately after a significant rainfall event.
        - Globally determined by rainfall intensity and duration+upstream charactristics; On catchment scale determined by
        catchment **size**, but other factors include **slope angles**, **shape** of catchment, soil type, vegetation type and percentage cover,
         degree of urbanisation and the **antecedent soil moisture**.
        - Steady periods between peaks is **baseflow** (Different from lowflow).

# Storm hydrograph in detail

        - Rising limb: Steep part leading to the highest flow.
        - Coming from: **Channel precipitation**: Rain coming directly to channel, and rapid runoff mechanism
        - Recession limb: After the limb and characterised by long, slow decrease in streamflow.
        - Influenced by storm water arriving at the mouth of a catchment, and through/groundwater flow.

        Exactly how much water moves to channelised flow from precipitation is one that cannot be easily answered.

        Very rare to find a thin sheet of rain above the surface.

        - **Overland flow**: Flow of water at surface after precipitation reaches the ground.
        - Horton 1933 .cite {horton1933role}: overland flow occurred when the rainfall rate was higher than the infiltration rate of a soil.\
            Excess water travels as a thin sheet of water.\
            Infiltration capacity works as a **barrier**.
        - .emph{But} infiltration rates are higher than most rainfall rates.

        - Betson 1964 .cite {betson1964watershed}: Partial areas concept, within a catchment only certain areas contribute to overland flow.\
            The role of infiltraion remains intact, but thin wate layer idea is being challenged.
        - Hewlett Hibbert 1967 .cite {mcdonnel2009hewlett}: Through a mixture of infiltration and throughfall the watertable would rise until in some places it reached the surface.\
            Overland flow is a mixture of return flow and rainfall fallin on saturated areas.
            Adjacent to stream channels and base of slopes: table is closest to the surface and likelies to overflow.

# Who was right?

.box title:{Ideas on stormflow} background:{.lightblue}
    - All were partially right!
    - Saturated overland flow is the dominant in humid, mid-latitude areas.
    - Variable source areas concept is the most valid description of stormflow processes.
    - In arid and semi-arid zones, extremely high rainfall rates + low infiltration rates (fed by convective storms, leading to **flash flooding**)
    - Instances of **hydrophobic soils** -> Nonlinear infiltration rates, extremely low first and then normal
